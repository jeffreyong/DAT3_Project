"Excellent food. Superb customer service. I miss the mario machines they used to have, but it's still a great place steeped in tradition."Yes this place is a little out dated and not opened on the weekend. But other than that the staff is always pleasant and fast to make your order. Which is always spot on fresh veggies on their hoggies and other food. They also have daily specials and ice cream which is really good. I had a banana split they piled the toppings on. They win pennysaver awards ever years i see why."All the food is great here. But the best thing they have is their wings. Their wings are simply fantastic!!  The ""Wet Cajun"" are by the best & most popular.  I also like the seasoned salt wings.  Wing Night is Monday & Wednesday night, $0.75 whole wings!""The dining area is nice. Very family friendly! The bar is very nice is well.  This place is truly a Yinzer's dream!!  """"Pittsburgh Dad"""" would love this place n'at!!"""I highly recommend this place. The mechanics are really honest and I'm usually in and out with no issues."I am a big believer in first impressions, so when I go to a new business I pay close attention to how they treat me and how they run their business. Joe was very polite and friendly as soon as I met him, as was his shop assistant. I needed a CV joint installed as well as a new transmission mount. Joe was nice enough to estimate a fair price to install both, he honored that price, was fast, very friendly, and treated me like he knew me for years. It's a great neighborhood shop and Joe is a real nice guy who could have easily raked me over the coals, but he didn't. I know quite a bit about cars, and everything he told me was true. He's earned my repeat business immediately. Give him a call, you'll be glad you did. Thanks Joe!"THANK YOU ROB! i truly appreciated all the help i received from this agent today who was able to removed the extra charges on my bill that the Pasadena Verizon Store on Lake was charging me on my bill for upgrading my phone.   When i went in i was having problems with my Blacberry and had to switch to the Iphone last week. Rob from the Pennsylvania store who i was connected today was able to look at my bill and all the notes and correct the problem immediately. Great Customer Service! He even set up a FOLLOW UP Phone Call with me On July 5th to make sure the credit goes through on my bill...I can't thank him enough!!!!"This place was DELICIOUS!!  My parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from Rick Sebak's ""25 Things I Like About Pittsburgh"" and he's usually pretty accurate.  His recommendations were to try the Reuben, Fish Sandwich and Open-Faced Steak Sandwich.  We went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a Saturday) and were seated right away.  The staff is extremely friendly.  My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich.  The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for!  Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50.  Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  We will definitely be back!!!  Oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take CASH ONLY.  So come prepared, but I'm pretty sure I saw an ATM there as well.  And I do believe they are closed on Sundays & Mondays."Can't miss stop for the best Fish Sandwich in Pittsburgh."This place should have a lot more reviews - but I'm glad it doesn't, they don't need to get any busier.""Its been there ages, and looks it. If you're all about ambiance, don't bother. If you pretend you're in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. The service is sometimes hit or miss. Most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you're happy. Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. ""The food is AWESOME! Worth any little complaints I might think up before it gets there. Once its on the table, I forget them all."-Fish Sandwiich-Salmon (huge and delicious)-Flounder"-Shrimp a few ways (""""Norfolk"""" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)"-Hawkins St Special"-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)""The prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. I'm not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don't want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem.""""Old school.....traditional ""mom 'n pop"" quality and perfection. The best fish and chips you'll ever enjoy and equally superb fried shrimp. A great out of the way, non-corporate, vestige of Americana. You will love it."Seen this restaurant on 25 best places in Pittsburgh with Rick Seback"ack. Went there with my girlfriend she grew up with the owner. She's very nice all employees are super nice service was excellent i had the fish sandwich my girlfriend had the Ruben more than you could possibly eat very reasonable prices. Going back to try the burgers  i heard there enormous and very tasty.""""Like a lot of recent patrons, I heard about Emil's from WQED.  The food is spectacular, the owner Chrissy and the staff treat you like family.  The food is like something your grandmother would make - classic dishes that are always consistently great and memorable.""After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.""Well, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.""And yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.""So off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. ""We walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'""This is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love."Oh...but good food counts too. "We each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!""My friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...""The waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. ""They only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.""Emil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here."You definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is."Addendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh.""""From reading the other reviews, I see this place was on some top 25 places in Pittsburgh list a few years ago.  I haven't seen it myself, but have known of this place for a while before my first visit in 2013.  It wasn't until my almost 80yo buddy, Mr. Italo Donatucci (world's coolest old Italian dude) brought me one of the best fish sandwiches I ever had that I became hooked!  I've had at least 10 since then, but only during the Lent season.  I gave my 5 rating based on the fish sandwich alone.  Try it without a bun also!  Either way you get 3 nice size pieces of fish equal to a pound.  You can have your choice of sides, but I always get the small mac n cheese for my side.  The staff is always really friendly and service is prompt.  It's in a rough neighborhood, but the Rankin police station is right across the street.  Almost every visit there I have seen police officers inside mingling with the locals or picking up lunch orders.  Soon I plan to make a visit that's not a Friday during Lent to try other menu items.""I love everything about this place. The food is delicious (yes yes, the fish sandwiches, OK, I agree -- but DID YOU TRY THE MEATBALLS?? holy tamoley), I adore the staff, and I love that there are no windows -- it's its own little hermetically sealed 1950s world of delicious, real food and good people. Lots of places try to create this kind of ambiance, but it can't be manufactured. It takes decades of good food and good vibes.""Also, the food is really good. :)""""I had a hankering for some fried fish tonight and the fish fry at Maximilian Kolbe was going to close before I got home on the bus, and I suggested to my wife and 12 year-old daughter that we try Emil's lounge as WQED's Rick Seback loved the place as did Andrew Zimmern when he visited for the Bizarre Foods America episode featuring Pittsburgh.  "The place is in Rankin - a rough around the edges town in the Mon Valley between Swissvale and Braddock.  Don't be put off at first - the outside doesn't have much decoration to speak of and looks like the sort of place that you might think twice about it.  A TGI Fridays it isn't... And thank god for that.The place is well-kept but a little dated -  no fripperies here.  But we're not here for the Decor - we're here for some dinner."The menu is basic with reasonable prices.  The meats and seafood are high quality and everything is made to order.  Their stuffed cabbage is regarded as the best in  Pittsburgh.  I love stuffed cabbage but I just made a batch a couple of weeks ago and I'm cabbaged out.  Their Ruebens are   also killer (our waitress raved about them).  My wife and I both settled on fish sandwiches.  These are true Pittsburgh fish Sammiches - fresh fried fish in crispy breading, crammed between enormous pillows of soft, yet chewy and crispy Mancini's Italian bread.  No adornments - just a boatload of hot crispy fish.  Emil's uses thick cod fillets piled high rather than a thin fillet that needs to be broken up to fit in the bun.  Truly a great sandwich.  My daughter had the BLT - looked good and on good bread and they weren't skimpy with the bacon."The service was very pleasant and friendly and the crowd was a great group of folks.  We all had fun with 4 other tables when my wife pulled up a Trivial Pursuit game on her iPhone and pretty much everyone joined in and had a good laugh."Overall, if you consider yourself a true Pittsburgher - you must visit this place.  It's one of the few places (Big Jim's in the Run is another) where the spirit of Pittsburgh is alive and hungry.  Please go.""""We have been coming here for over 30 years, consistantly good food and friendly staff. Vwey reasonably priced and large portions. The owner, Chrissy has taken what Emil started years ago and built it into a place we will return to again and again. Favorites are the fish and burgers, hard to pick one!""We had gone to the Frick Mansion for a tour and I told my friends we were stopping off for a lunch in Rankin. There wasn't much enthusiasm about the location but the reluctantly agreed.  We stopped in front and my wife said we aren't going in there are we? Well once the order the food and enjoyed the best Reuben,  fish sandwich and stuffed peppers they were sold. The owner came over and thanked us for stopping. She is a real asset to the place. The restrooms were spotless, which important to my wife. I have taken places where she had to hover  over the commode. I went back two days later for the hulushki. A real gem a perfect place to eat real comfort food. Don't forget the liver and onions.""Excellent fish sandwich, Wonderful Reuben Sandwich, even the stuffed cabbage tastes homemade.   Chrissy ""Is a delightful hostess and makes you feel welcome.  Restaurant personnel are pleasant.   I really enjoy visiting Emils when I'm in town   My only regret is that they are closed Mondays.   Worth the trip""""Awesome drink specials during happy hour. Fantastic wings that are crispy and delicious, wing night on Tuesday and Thursday!"Grew up near here. the family would always go once a month. Haven't stopped in for a few years until last Friday with a few friends to grab a drink. The sandwiches are always amazing just as I remember. The staff is amazing and friendly. Great place for lunch as well."Let there be no question: Alexions owns the best cheeseburger in the region and they have now for decades. Try a burger on Italian bread. The service is flawlessly friendly, the food is amazing, and the wings? Oh the wings... but it's still about the cheeseburger. The atmosphere is inviting, but you can't eat atmosphere... so go right now. Grab the car keys... you know you're hungry for an amazing cheeseburger, maybe some wings, and a cold beer! Easily, hands down, the best bar and grill in Pittsburgh.""The sandwiches, the wings, enough said. Alexions can best be described as a home-style Primantis before they went mega commercial. You really can't go wrong, but for my money, I would put Alexions fish sandwich up with the best I've had. That's not to take away from other selections, but if you come here I recommend not leaving until you've had either the fish sandwich, Reuben, or wings. ""You'll know you're in a Pittsburgh bar when you walk in. For someone who lives in Atlanta now and only makes it to Pittsburgh a few times a year, I have to say it is refreshing. Feels like home. I haven't had a trip back without making it out to Alexions at least once.""""Friendly staff, good food, great beer selection, and relaxing atmosphere. Great wings and the buffalo chicken pizza is the best I've had. The sandwiches are all on thick cut Italian bread and fresh. Definitely  a hidden gem of the Greetree/Carnegie area. Looking for a low key hole in the wall with good prices and great food this is your place.""Found this place on Yelp and glad we did. Great beer selection, the sandwiches are wonderful and huge, wings were very good. Family owned establishment and everyone we met was great, the owner, waitstaff and kitchen staff.  If we ever get to The Pittsburgh area again, we will go back!"Awesome experience!   I came in all fatalistic with my flat tire on a workday morning with a full schedule. They saw me and worked on my car like a NASCAR pit crew.I was prepared to buy new tires.  They offered to look to see if they could repair."They repaired them.  I saved alot of money.  #integrity #greatcustomerservice""""Our cat went out the other night and must have gotn into a fight. He was wounded but we could not tell the extent of his injuries. My girlfriend called them today and they made an appt for us immediately.  When we got there, I couldn't believe how friendly and caring they all were. We went into the exam room with doctor Tierney Kelley and a vet asst Sam. They were the best. So gentle and caring. They did not pressure us into any procedures that my cat did not need. They worked hard So we didn't have to leave him over night. This was by far the best veterinarian I have gone to in all my years as a pet owner. This has all become a racket for making money. Doctors don't care about the animals in 90% of the places you go, but Greetree animal clinic is not one of those places. I will be taking my other pets there from now on and recommend this place and Doctor Kelly to everyone I know. Thank you so much again if you read this. Doctors Kelley you're the best.""Greentree Animal clinic is the absolute best!  We have had both Dr Mann and Dr. Reuther.  Both are very good, each in their own strengths.  I recently had to have my beloved dog euthanized due to a tumor growing on his hip.  Dr. Mann was very sensitive and caring to my feelings of loss.  He offered to make a clay paw print from my dog after he passed.  He went above and beyond to make sure he had a peaceful passing with me by his side.  Thank you for allowing me that experience, and for guiding me through the process."I cannot praise this place enough. I have worked as a vet tech in a previous job and have had experiences at numerous facilities here in Pittsburgh and Greentree Animal Clinic blows them all out of the water. Key things that you should note about this place:* They do not over charge"* They only recommend services/things that they genuinely believe will help your pet, not their bottom line and they do not pressure you in any way"* They are respectful and genuine to you and your pet which is hard to come by nowadays"* Everyone from the front desk to the techs, to the vets are kind, patient and understanding. No condescension or poor attitudes, just positive vibes all around. ""* Dr Brown goes above and beyond any vet I've ever met. He has shown so much care, professionalism,  kindness and knowledge that I will gladly refer anyone with a pet to him because I know they will be in good hands and his fellow vets (Dr Reuther, Dr Kelley, and Dr Mann)  are just as phenomenal. ""Thankyou Greentree Animal Clinic for setting the bar where it should be for all Veterinary Care Facilities."""Beautiful restoration of the library and music hall.   Look forward to coming here for shows.Great people... great service... great products... always busy"This SnS and the one in Bethel Park are my two favorites.  Staff always friendly and the deli staff in both locations are great!  In my experience, if teen staff don't know where something is, they ask another staff member.  Shopping these two stores is as pleasant as it gets.""I went to Rossi's for my first time, two weeks ago. I had two suits and one jacket tailored. Everything was ready in less than two weeks. These suits were brand new and on the expensive side. I didn't know who to trust them with. I went to Rossi's because a friend highly recommended them. My friend had a tuxedo custom made by Rossi's. "I am extremely happy with the end results!"I wanted a European cut on jackets and no break on the slacks; a nice tailored look. The suits look awesome. I'm going to go through my closet and take some of my older suits to be tailored (some of my older suits are a little looser fitting; I now like the more tailored European look). Juliano (the owner) will shorten the length of my jackets, take the sides in and shorten my slacks. They'll look brand new.""As for the price, I'm very happy. I wouldn't go to the cheapest barber in town (for obvious reason). I feel the same about a good tailor. As for the service, they couldn't be nicer.

You will not be able to finish this sandwich in one seating."Enjoy....""""This is a great little gem!  On my last visit to Pittsburgh I was looking for a nice bar/pub/lounge to grab dinner and watch a Penguins playoff game.  A friend of mine who lived in the area recommended Rocky's.  As I walked in the door I was pleasantly approached by the server and shown a table. It was clean, welcoming and the lounge was busy. It was Friday night and the special was the fish fry.  I ordered the fish and in the meantime I sipped on a draft brew.  The order was delivered to my table in no time.  The fish and sides were tasty and the portion size was large. As I was watching the game and enjoying the heck out of my dinner I noticed a dessert case with a nice selection of cakes.  Well needless to say I got a togo box for what was left of my dinner and ordered a slice of cheesecake.  Another good choice!  At the end of night the Penguins couldn't pull off the win over the Rangers but I definitely have a new ""go to"" when I'm in town.  Another star could be added for a smoke free environment.  I don't smoke but I understand they have a nice outdoor area for those who do.""Italian dinners, American, endless soup and salad bar is great. Most food for your dollar. I highly recommend. Great bar. Good place to watch a game. The bar can get quite noisy in the evenings, but it adds to the great atmosphere at Rocky's""Stick to basics and this is the best place in or around the 'burgh.  First time go with a friend and sit at the counter.  Short order cooking at it's best, it's like a floor show with the actor's backs to you.  Breakfast has no losers.  Eggs, omelets, pancakes, waffles, breakfast sandwiches to order, the ever popular mixed grill, get a 1/2 Louie instead of home fries (although they good as is) and don't forget the italian toast.""Frequently voted the best burger in Pittsburgh for a reason.  As for ambiance, well lets just say I don't think there are two matching plates or coffee mugs in the joint.  But the coffee's good and hot and refreshed often as the service is good, andlocal with many long time folks working here.  If I don't get there for awhile I need to go through detox because I feel too healthy.""""Cheap, unpretentious, and, for this, one of my favorite breakfast joints in the country.  Simply put I LOVE it here.  The mixed grill, the sausage and egg on a biscuit, the home fries.  This it the very definition of diner.  Thank you Gab 'n' Eat!""Okay, let's first set expectations.  This place is a true DIVE...this is not for the NYC foodie crowd.  If you want a down home, large portion awesome breakfast, this is the place.  The place is packed with happy diners, the server was very friendly in a busy grandma kind of way.  The best part - they have ""dippy"" eggs on the menu and define the degree of dippy you can order.  For anyone who has never heard of a ""dippy"" egg - this means sunny side up or over medium where the eggs are still runny and you can dip your bread in them.  The eggs were great - I ordered mine over medium, the breakfast potatoes were fab - no complicated additives like peppers or onions - just plain good potatoes cooked in fat - the best part - the fresh Italian bread.  YUM!!!""I've lived in Pittsburgh for 6 years, and in Carnegie for over 2 years, and by far, this is the best greasy spoon joint I've found. If you can stomach the wait (no reservations, naturally), you'll enjoy overflowing plates of goodness, thanks to the well-seasoned griddle where all of the food is made. "Here are the highlights:"-Cheap: Breakfast for two can be well under $10, with lunch around the same.""-Crowded: Get there early and expect to wait. They close pretty early on the weekends too (oddly, at 12:45pm)"-Cash only"-Huge portions: When ordering fries or homefries, always get the half order, unless you're a lumberjack""-About those homefries: They're often undercooked. I've had better, believe me. My favorite things to eat in life are potato products.""-My favorite item: hot sausage sandwich on thick Italian toast, with cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo"""Love this place.  Never had a bad meal.  Good portions and great people.  Be ready to stand in line."My favorite breakfast place.  Have good sandwiches also.  Stopped again for Bfast and had the mixed grill--get the small portion unless you are a real MAN!  Mixed grill has sausage, (could it be Ricci's?), eggs, onions, and home fries, soooo goooooooood!  Use Mancini's bread for toast, got the raisin toast - Yum.  ""Have had many other items and just love the food.  If you like to watch a true cook, sit at the counter.  Banter with the cook and staff and patrons is fun!""Lunch is good, sausage sandwich, hamburgers and other lunch meats fried on the grill."Gets busy for Bfast so you may have to wait."Remember it is a diner.  Don't expect fancy decor.""""Great breakfast place. Come hungry. Look for Dick, my dad, and Gino at the counter every a.m. about 0830 and say hi. Try the mixed grill (half).""BEST DINER IN THE COUNRTY!!! We've been to many famous diners across the country and we still give  Gab and Eat the best rating !! I was a little intimidated when I first walked in and there was like 2 pounds of butter just sitting on top of the homefires on the grill.  If you are looking for a healthy breakfast they probably can accomodate you, but Everything I ate was clearly the opposite of healthy.  After trying like every meal they have I would recommend the mix grill(half unless you are sharing) adding cajun seasoning with the texas toast.  Burgers are great too.""It's hard to find a place that makes a better breakfast than you could make by yourself at home, but this place does it.  The atmosphere is classy, old school Americana.""""Best French toast ever!! Love the friendly atmosphere, and especially the breakfast. Never been disappointed. You have to try French toast with raisin bread too... yummy!"Great Diner!  Their breakfast is the best in the area!  Lots of  choices and always good.  Love the unique mugs they use for coffee and all the writing on the wall.  Get there early otherwise you will not get a seat!  They have homemade hot/sweet sausage and texas toast."Readers of my reviews may recall that I once referred to The Dor-Stop as possibly the best breakfast in Pittsburgh.  Well, faithful followers, I must now admit that The Dor-Stop has now been verified as only one of the best.  Why?  That's because Gab and Eat I have now found to be THE best breakfast I've ever had.  If it was closer to my home I would quickly become a regular.""I easily decided to order the Mixed Grill (Half).  Before I go on, I must ask...has anyone seen a full order?  Because I honestly can't imagine how much food that is.  I created my own with bacon, cheese, eggs and potatoes.  Based on reviews I also opted to get a side of the sausage and was pleased as punch when our waitress asked if I wanted hot or sweet....or one of each.  I like variety, so I jumped on the change to try both.  I also selected the Italian toast - what other kind is there, really?  ""When my food arrived, it looked delicious.  There was so much bacon that after eating half of my Mixed Grill it looked like I'd barely started.  The sausage was great, just don't ask me which one I liked best.  My toast?  4 thick slices that looked to be about half the loaf and were buttered on both sides. It was a struggle, but I was determined to enjoy every tasty morsel and not leave a crumb.   ""In case anyone is wondering, yes, they use real butter.  I saw pounds of it stacked in the kitchen with my own two eyes.  The wait staff was quick and efficient as well as helpful and friendly with our larger group of 9 people.  The fact that none of the plates match and I noticed a sign at the front register that said, """"We need mugs"""" just makes me love this place even more.""A few tips: 1.) Order the Mixed Grill.  2.) Cash only!  3.) Gab and Eat is a popular place but also very small and narrow (or cozy if you will).  I recommend going during the week when they are still busy but can accomodate a group.  That way you won't feel rushed or crowded.  4.) Get to Gab and Eat ASAP!  You'll be glad you did!""""Classic breakfast joint.  Grimy looking hole in the wall located on one end of a seedy looking strip mall.  Window is opaque due to the grease so you can't hardly see inside. On the outside, there are about a dozen people waiting to get in.  When you finally do get inside, you see that there are 15 tables and a counter, all occupied by people from all walks of life.""What's the attraction behind this flea hole?  The FOOD!  Lots of it and dirt cheap.  I sat at a vacant stool behind the formica counter and ordered the mixed grill.  Potatoes, eggs, sausage, bacon and Italian toast.  A giant mound of food guaranteed to sooth any hangover.  I swear the full mixed grill had two pounds of food.  Neat thing is that the grill is right in front of you so you can see your potatoes and eggs frying in a pool of fresh grease.  All that food, plus coffee and tip for around ten bucks.  Cash only, so put that plastic away.""Only bad thing that could happen is some douche bag from the Food Network or Travel Channel will make this place famous, and then I'll never be able to get in."""Best breakfast in Carnegie PA"Best breakfast spot in the area, If you like diner food it is the place to go. Small, so you will want to avoid the church crowd on Sundays, but the wait is never too long.  Everyone is friendly and has obviously been working there for a while.  If you are feeling like lunch food go a little later, their burgers are made on the breakfast griddle and are delicious."I always love a good diner.  Gab and Eat was just what we were looking for on a Saturday morning.  Good food.  Great people. Pittsburgh ambiance. "This place is obviously a beloved neighborhood gem.  I had french toast and bacon.  The french toast was made with the best Italian bread.  My fiance had what they called a 'mixed grill.""""  It consisted of eggs, peppers, onions and home made sausage.  Not something you would eat everyday, but he loved it!   They also had great coffee.  They actually ground up the beans in front of us.  Now that's fresh.""We want to return sometime for """"turkey day.""""  Apparently they made fresh turkey every Tuesday.  Now that sounds good!""Can't wait to return.""""This is exactly what a breakfast place should be like--comfortable, quirky, unpretentious and with inexpensive, large portioned working class breakfast plates.""On our current road trip of baseball, brews, hockey and diners, we decided to try Gab & Eat based on yelpers rating putting it #1 for breakfast in Pittsburgh area. We have to agree with most other reviewers that this is a place to eat."We arrived around noon on Saturday and were happy there were a couple open tables. The place is tucked at the end of a strip mall and you have to look to find it. There is plenty of parking.Inside the decor is quaint and funky at the same time. Country style decorations and signs are mixed with nostalgia signs & posters. Most interesting are all the signatures and comments written on the wall by past customers. We regretted not having a marker to add ours. The other highlight was three large white boards with trivia questions - fun way to spend time waiting for food."The waitstaff there is...uh, experienced. They are attentive, pleasant and efficient."After reading reviews I had to try the Mixed Grill. But S went with pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes were outstanding...maybe the best either of us has eaten. They were thick but with light texture and rich flavor. His bacon was cooked just as requested - as crisp as possible - and very flavorful."The Mixed Grill is a mixed together concoction of eggs, potatoes, onions, peppers, cheese, and spicy Italian sausage grilled together. I'm glad I heeded those who stressed going with the half size order. It filled a full sized dinner plate with a heaping order. I couldn't finish it all and that's rare. How do they serve the whole potion -- in a trough?"Everything was cooked well. The sausage added a nice bite to offset the somewhat plain potatoes. You can build your own mix but the basic was a good mix.My only complaint was the amount of potato and that they are pretty plain. I like home fries with lots of seasoning that have aged on the grill. These potatoes were pretty uniform chunks with little seasoning. Personal preference.It usually comes with Italian toast but they were out so I went with raisin. It was delicious soft inch thick slices.Coffee was excellent and the cup stayed full. The total was less than $15. Fabulous value for the quality and portions."While I can't say it's the best breakfast in Pittsburgh (only here 3 days), its the best so far and one of the best we've had."""This is a perfect example of what a breakfast diner can be: excellent breakfasts in huge portions for cheap. I had the western omlet and will be getting it or another omlet again soon"The coffee was good, totally serviceable diner coffee. The waitress was wonderfully friendly and hopping around from table to table. The food was excellent. The ambience was exactly right for a diner. It was packed. The wait was not nearly as long as I was expecting. 10 minutes maybe.""Totally recommended. Come hungry."""Wow! Read the great reviews and I was not let down. Huge portions. The mixed grill was THE best breakfast I've ever had. If you go to Pittsburgh it is a must eat. Service was superb. Friendly staff. Led zeppelin on the walls. .....what else could you ask for?"I have been coming to Gab n Eat for almost 20 years and They have never let me down. I get a typical breakfast if eggs, ham, toast, and home fries. Delicious as usual. The ambience however is usually lacking. The walls are dark, with writing and signatures of semi famous people all over the place. Pictures of local people hang on the walls(i secretly want mine up there) along with posters galore. While its fun to look at the first 10 times, it gets a little boring after awhile. So today when I arrived I expected the same old experience. Wow was I wrong! As soon as I looked at the door I knew something was different. The place seemed lighter and brighter. To my pleasant surprise, they painted and got new counter tops!! They're not quite done yet but the place has a new Happy vibe to it. The awesome breakfast, the new decor and the 5 guys sitting at the counter making me laugh are why I will be back( maybe for lunch).""A gem. The coffee cups are mismatched . The owner is three feet away from me cooking. The sausage is made for them locally. And the food is frickin awesome. I had the pancakes, my daughter had the sausage and egg sandwich.  Cash only.  Friendly service."Excellent breakfast and lunch menu. Friendly staff and super food. Modest environment with excellent food. Worth the wait.. dont miss this one. "Best breakfast and lunch food in the Pgh South Hills hands down.""""What a find! I stopped in here for breakfast while in town for business. The service is so friendly I thought I was down south. The service was quick, frankly and felt like I was with family. ""Fantastic poached eggs, Cajun homefries and crispy bacon. Gab and Eat is definitely a place I world recommend to locals. I was stuffed and the bill was only $8.00.""""Been coming here for a decade or so whenever my wife and I get the chance, and have NEVER been disappointed!""The perfect blend of non-chain-tightly-packed ambiance,friendly older waitresses who have been there since I started going, cheap for what you get prices, and food with taste and amounts that """"Aunt Bee"""" would be proud of.""Never had anything that wasn't hot,freshly made before my eyes,and down home """"gooooooooooood""""' as Andy might say.""As my wife and I agree,this """"joint"""", has been for some time now the overall gold standard by which our eaten out breakfasts have been measured against!""One visit...and you will be a believer, and most times I've been there the owner is cooking at the grill herself."""A fine breakfast joint. You gotta love the small diners. Highly recommended."Gab n Eat is the best breakfast in Pittsburgh and always a treat.  We went there around 11:30 which brought up the lunch. Vs breakfast debate. I saw another customers soup and knew i would have to try it. The soup was a  Lobster Bisque and it was amazing.....creamy deliciousness. I could have had a quart of it. Yum!  I ended up ordering the create your own mixed grill. (When at Gab n Eat. You have to order the 1/2 grill) I had mine with bacon. Bacon was crisp and delish. and M ordered the regular mixed grill. We also shared an order of potato pancakes. They even brought us 2 sides of applesauce and sour cream. The pancakes could have been a tiny bit crisper, but still very good.""Great food, great service, and a great ""diner"" atmosphere.  It's the kind of place that allows you to decompress and enjoy good conversation with friends."One of my favorite breakfast stops in Pittsburgh! Can't beat the hometown feel of this place. Always had great service.One of those places you only hear about from a friend...tucked in a strip mall...only open for breakfast and lunch. The local atmosphere surpasses the food and that's a helluva compliment.  Mixed grill is the choice for breakfast.  They will mix and match meats and how you want your eggs along with toast. Their burgers are up there with the best in Pittsburgh. "A hidden gem. Don't miss it.""""What a great diner!  Yummy food, friendly staff and a welcoming atmosphere.  This is a place you have to try.  Then you will keep coming back."THE best breakfast place BY FAR. I never even liked breakfast food until trying their eggs and French toast.Great greasy spoon!"Arrived early, around 7:15 am on a weekday. Had no trouble finding a seat. Just as we were sitting down, a waitress asked if we wanted coffee. Of course, and how lovely!""We had a couple of questions about the mixed grill sizes because we didn't want too much, as the reviews here stated that the portions were huge. The waitress was super nice and answered all of our questions. We ended up splitting the half-sized mixed grill, and it was PLENTY!""Great diner quality, but I think I'll try the same dish without the cheese next time-it was an American cheese, and I don't think the grill needed it. ""Coffee was always hot, and service was so quick! This place is a hot spot!""Cash only - be prepared.""""Wonderful omelets, coffee, and staff! The prices are great and the food is prepared quickly! Veggie omelet with cheese is my favorite!""They have done it again! Excellent little establishment with their home town feeling. Mix match coffee mugs, smiling waitresses, open front diner kitchen feel. Went in there In the mood for lunch while my date was craving breakfast. It's a seat your own kinda establishment, so we found a table at the very far back, sat down and were greater right away and asked if we wanted coffee to start out mornings. Agreed and both cups were promptly filled and re filled as the meal went along without hesitation. I ordered the hot Italian, had fried salami and Bologna on it with cheese, dressing, and lettuce.... Bun was a smidge small for all the goodies in it but what's to complain about there?  My Date got the bagel sandwich and ""Hey Rayed"" it (adding breakfast potatoes and cole slaw) it was amazing and large enough that she now has lunch as well. I also got a cup the chicken poblano soup, pretty fantastic! Always a great place to travel to, always a good story to listen to when ya strike up a convo with the locals, always great and friendly. Highly recommend!"This place is great. Best ham and cheese inlet I've ever had! Their burgers are also delicious. Nice flat-top crust on the burger. I only wish they were open for dinner too!"This place is by far the best place for breakfast....but today...I decided to get lunch. {Only because it was lunch time...but they do serve breakfast at this time, too.}. I got the turkey club on wholewheat...OMG...it was delish.  Too much for me to eat because it came with a large plate of home made French Fries.  If you are really hungry and don't count calories...make a stop here.""Barb's Country Junction gets a 5 star rating for me because it is truly everything that a Pittsburgh restaurant should be.  In addition to being the apple of my nostalgia's eye, it is also the constant thought of my tummy when I'm hungry on the weekends.  ""Barb's breakfasts cannot be beat, but truly any meal you get there you won't regret.  Everything is made to order, with fair portions, and great prices. My recommendation is a breakfast sandwich on a bagel and a coffee.  There's nothing better than drinking from a cup that could have come from your grandma's kitchen.""I know that Gab N Eat is nearby, and Barb's can be a little weird get to with the strange traffic pattern but this really is a gem of Carnegie that you've gotta try!"""Great little place. Treats you like a local.Eaten here 3 times a week for a month.  Same overtime. Barb is always here."This is a great place to eat and everyone is so friendly. I live right down the street from here but unfortunately, I have only gone a once. Trust me, I will go here more often. The food is great, prices are low, and the staff are friendly. My cousin and I wanted a place to eat and catch up and this was perfect place. I will go here more often."Tonya is super sweet and the front desk people are very helpful"I have said it on other sites and will repeat here. You MUST try their burgers. They are juicy and delicious with a bun that is perfect. Another must are the fries with Guinness gravy and if you haven't had enough go for the ultimate sleeper, Leek and potato soup. Authentic black & tans. Harp and Murphys on tap. It don't get no better. This is a true gem my friends.""New to area and decided to pay this shop a visit! It was definitely the best experience I've ever had with a tailor. He is MUCH cheaper than the other shops, he charges 10 while others charge $15, and he goes above and beyond for what he charges.""I dropped off 4 jeans, and he hemmed and tapered the jeans! I couldn't even tell the difference between the store bought jeans and the quality of his work. It was absolutely perfect, no bulges or puckers! They the match the exact stitch as the factory. ""Absolutely a great guy, they were all done and waiting for me as promised! I'll definitely be taking all of my business to this place, and would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a personal tailor who actually cares about his work and building an honest business.""""I needed alterations done to my suit very quickly. Like three days quickly. Not only did Filberto at Alteration World have it ready, the price was beyond reasonable and the work was EXCELLENT! I plan on bringing all my clothes to him from now on.""Oh and he let me know that they also dry-clean. Wonderful shop!""""This is the best alteration place I have been to. The guy that owns it is extremely helpful and works FAST. Also, the prices are so reasonable I wonder how he stays in business. He was able to do an alteration on short notice and was very acommodating. The alteration I needed done--and fast--was right in the middle of prom season. All the other places I called gave me a several week wait, but he took me right away. I will be back!"I just needed a broken zipper replaced on my favorite Penguins fleece jacket and a pair of suit pants hemmed.  The price was very reasonable and the work done was great.  I will go back for all my tailoring needs and highly recommend if you need any done."So happy I found this place! I'm new to the Pittsburgh area and wasn't sure if it was worth driving to Carnegie to come here, but Yelp convinced me. It was completely worth the trip! Since it would have been a long trip to come back, the guys at Alteration World finished my work (patching a hole on a pair of jeans) in less than half an hour (I killed time at an adorable coffee shop across the street) and exactly as I had specified. Oh, and the price was extremely reasonable as well. Thanks Yelp for another great find!"My bridesmaid dress alterations were perfect. I would not hesitate to come back for alterations or dry cleaning."The service, quality, and speed of Alteration World are incredible! I have had suits and pants altered here and have been thoroughly impressed by the work. Everything has fit perfectly and the work was quality. I will be returning here exclusively for my tailoring needs and have referred many customers already. If you need anything altered (or even something custom made), do not hesitate to go to Alteration World."I really don't understand these reviews.  I have used Greetree Auto Body for years and they have been absolutely wonderful.  They are a preferred shop with most insurance companies and it is because they do very good work at reasonable prices.  I would highly recommend Greentree Auto Body to anyone."It's deep fried garbage....it's LOS c'mon what do you expect.....however I have never had better, friendlier service at a fast food restaurant.""All I need to say is that my 6 year old could not wait to see Dr. Weinberg and her staff! Not only are they professional and kind,  they have made my child have a life time of good oral health care!  This busy mom loves that they can provide two appointments, at the same time.  I can't imagine having a better family dentist!"Just moved to the area and needed a dentist after getting my front tooth chipped playing hockey.  She did an amazing job at fix my tooth and cleaned up the front teeth while doing it.  I was able to get in and have my tooth fixed within a few days of it happening.  I've gotten a few fillings as well after my chip was fixed.  The doctor is great and so are the staff.  I would recommend going here.The crew at West Penn Dental Centers is fantastic.  I'm always greeted with a smile at the front desk and everyone working there is very friendly.  Dr. Steines is an exceptional dentist and every one of the hygienists that have cleaned my teeth are exceptionally personable and well skilled at their craft.  The practice is small but clean and cozy.  A previous review claims that it's in a shady part of Carnegie.  This couldn't be further from the truth.  The office is on a nice street with a large parking lot just off of Main Street.  They also provide easy scheduling with email & text confirmations so you don't forget your appointment.  I highly recommend West Penn Dental.Good quality work and really nice staff. They definitely don't treat you like a number.The office has been in Carnegie forever. I have been going there for years and have always had good direct communication about anything I need. My questions are always answered and I will continue with my dentist as long as he's there."Perfect time with hubby, after work which is 4 am and you can still have a hot nice meal, waitress was such an adorable girl. Her arm was broken or smth but she still dis a great job!"Strawberry lemonade was just smth i have been craving for for so long but did not know what it was :) "Strawberry milkshake, nachos and t bone steak is smth we never stop ordering!""Its always nice when u go late at night like us, it is not crowded, not noisy, nice music playing and always nice people around. ""If you want smth quick and it is late at night then i would say Denny's!""""This location never disappoints!! Food is always consistently great, and if you come at the right time, (witching hours) you may see the cook singing and dancing along with the music in the back. And it is awesome! ! Love this place!!""Excellent food , good service too I have had several different dishes here and all have been excellent""I like the food at Denny's more than meals served at pricier restaurants. My favorite is the Bourbon Chicken Skillet. Even though it isn't advertised as being gluten-free, it doesn't have any ingredients containing wheat- just chicken, potatoes, and broccoli in a yummy Jack Daniels sauce. Both Eat n Park and Max and Erma's have gone downhill in the past few years, but the food at Denny's has gotten better.""As a member for now 8 years I can honestly say, I have never had a negative experience at Amerifit!  The owner and staff could not be more accommodating and strive for member satisfaction.  The owner not only runs the business but personally fixes machines when needed, interacts with the members, and also personally salts and plows the parking lot when needed in the winter himself.  ""There is another review on here stating the lot didn't have any attention after which was the largest ice storm we've had in years. I would like to state I was sitting by the counter the day this lady came in upset and unnecessarily yelling at the front desk employee about the lot.  The owner was out there every couple hours doing the best he could to tame the condition of the lot. However on that day I believe everyone's car on the road turned into a snow sled including my own.  If you truly felt in danger being on the roads that day, you probably should of just stayed at home or a work.""I love the fact the owner takes pride in his business and is extremely hands on with the maintenance of the building.  Amerifit has such a welcoming, no intimidation, home-like feel which is what I believe makes this place so special and unique and has kept my loyal membership for the last 8 years.""""I brought my husband and my parents all to Papa J's last time my husband and I were in Pittsburgh. My parents are really picky about their italian food, usually they drive places in east bumf*@ (tarentum, ligonier...) to get their capital I-talian.""My pop is kinda grumbly, and getting him to try something new is like pulling teeth. The only reason I got him here was becuase they were on their way to drop us at the airport.""Well, my dad goes back now regularly and that says a lot, considering he lives in Murrysville. ""The first good sign Dad was happy was that he seemed impressed when it was open- it was noon a few days after Christmas. Second good sign was that Dad ordered wine, at it was only 1 pm. Dad, while not a teetotaler, rarely has a drink before 5 pm so I know he was anticipating a good meal. The kicker was that he was so happy he left our waitress a $20 tip on a $50 meal. ""Can I say, I live in Texas now and I still relive this afternoon back in December? I had chicken picatta...it was perfect. My dad had eggplant rollatini, my mom had a pizza, and my hubby had basic pasta and marinara. It all was amazing, delicous, and inexpensive. In Austin, you can't get a decent italian meal, much less a decent italian meal for under $50 for four people.""I know there are so many good Italian places in Pittsburgh but I just think back so fondly on this day...when me Dad liked someplace I took him :)""""Papa J's is by far my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh, my hometown.  I eat there almost every time I visit, and everything I've ever ordered has been fantastic.  Fresh ingredients, simple preparation, reasonable prices.  Also, they make the best pizza in town HANDS DOWN.""This place has been a favorite for 20 years since we returned from a trip to Italy having several weeks of fabulous fresh food, and couldn't think of any place we wanted to eat. Papa J's measures up to our expectations with great salads, bead and wine. I'm partial to the eggplant rollatini and my husband likes samplers, ravioli, fish, white pizza. I like the space with exposed brick walls-there are knowledgeable servers. Sometimes it is a bit loud- more noticable when it is empty with a large table nearby. But don't get the wrong impression -it's a great place-consistantly great food.""Great, authentic, classic Italian restaurant in one of the most unlikely places. "I grew up eating here and make a visit nearly every time I come to town."Try the fried calamari """"Roman Style"""" for a little kick!""""What a wonderful surprise found in Carnegie PA, just south of Pittsburgh.  I was in town on business with a couple co-workers and after having a not so great meal the night before, we asked one of the locals for a recomendation.  They told us to try this little Italian place called Papa J's and boy did they send us to a great place.""First off, when you walk up to the place, the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside.  You can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door.""I am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used, while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern, almost as if it had been freshly updated.  ""The server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked.  The three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things, so we began with a Margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect.  They obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and I don't think this pizza could have tasted any better.  Then came bowls of Italian wedding soup which was pretty good.  Of everything there, this was the one item I probably could have done without.  Not that it was bad, but there was nothing particularly special about it.  ""We also ordered the Garlic Rolls (not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for 1 meal) and they were to die for.  Crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside, these things were a meal by themselves.  One of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce (which is fresh made there, not out of some can) and he was right.  As if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good enough, dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better.  ""By the time our meals came, we were all pretty full, but we pushed on and continued to eat.  I had the Veal Parmigiano which was tender and very good.  It came with a side of pasta which I tasted just to try and it was excelent as well.  Had I not been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre-meal stuff, I certainly would have finished it.  As it was, I ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal.  "One of my co-workers had the Chicken Picatta which he said was one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good as well.  They had a great wine selection as well at reasonable prices by the glass or bottle."Overall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere.  I don't really know how expensive the area is for food, but coming from the Chicagoland area, I fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable.  The three of us ate very very well for an average of aproximately $30 each not including alcahol.  Fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price, who could ask for more.""My only complaint is that I had to return to Chicago and I am now craving to return to Papa J's.  I hope work sends me out here again sometime soon!!!""""Delicious!  Everything I've ever had here was great!  The white pizza is a MUST!  Always amazing!  I'm also a big fan of the chicken piccatta.  The bread that they bring to the table is delicious too!  They have a wide variety of selections on the menu and they also have nightly specials that always sound great!  Their prices are also reasonable.  Overall, I highly recommend this place!""2nd times a charm. This place was 3.5 starts the first time I came, but stepped up large tonight.  Waitress was righteous and very fun.  Food was all excellent.  Caesar salad tasty--got with tomatoes big $ on that, fettuccini carbornara with bacon n smoky cream flavor.  Can't wait for the leftovers!!  The white pizza is that star though.  The crust/dough is heavenly and the flavor is top shelf.  I don't throw those accolades out easily, especially on pie, but this joint serves it up.  Good vibe, great service, phenomenal food.  Ill be back.""I love this place! The food is always so fresh and delicious. The staff is always friendly, as well."It was just what we were looking for. The service was great. My husband had the veal sausage on green pepper appetizer in the larger size. It was great (spicy) and enough for a meal. I had the stuffed eggplant. That was very good but the sauce could have been a bit heartier. I would definitely go back. Really nice atmosphere and free parking in the back.Some of the best chow around--love this place. The bread and salads and soups are great."Finally, great Tuscan-style Italian food in Pittsburgh, not that tasteless stuff that locals think is Italian.""The bread was warm and fresh. The bolognese sauce was creamy and rich, and unlike most restaurants was made with veal. I love the fresh smell of baking bread throughout the restaurant.""I'm looking forward to working my way through the menu of chicken options, and next time, I'm saving room for dessert! The display of cakes and pastries at the door was amazing."""Wonderful food. Some items a little over priced. But never disappointed.I have friends that LOVE the white pizza. I have seen two people eat their weight in the stuff.I love their fresh salads. HUGE. The house dressing is perfect every time. We have been there many times and it just doesn't get old."We always have the beans and greens. The meatball appetizer is superb. By-pass the chicken parm, it's the only thing we have ever found lacking....it's just really plain. The alfredo is excellent.""We, almost never go anywhere else in Carnegie because we like this place so much.""""We came to Carnegie to check out the Black Lamb consignment shop. Lucky for us that we also discovered PaPa J's--we loved it! The fried calamari appetizer was excellent, as was the fettuccine carbonara. We'll be headed back to this place as often as we can for a real Italian dining experience."This is it. My favorite in the Pittsburgh area. I moved out of the area for 10 years and this was the first meal I had back. There was a table of Italians speaking Italian behind me - how much more authentic can you get?!?"I bring all of my out of town guests here and not one had been left disappointed. My recommendations are to order the mozzarella carozza (or however it's spelled) and then one of the specials. If you aren't into a special, you'll be fine - order off the menu. But the specials are typically amazing. ""When my better half was living 4 hours away, he drove into town and I made him get back in he car to go here. Instead if complaining, he asked if we could take his parents next time."""Stopped in for lunch after I got lost due to construction in the area. Was trying to go to a different place. Glad the Pizza Gods were looking out for me. Ordered a caesar salad with anchovies and a large pizza with sausage and mushrooms. The salad was fresh and excellent. Dressing was made fresh and the anchovies were top notch. There is a wide variety of anchovies when it comes to quality and they use excellent ones. There was also plenty of them as usually you get a sparse amount. The large salad was more that enough for my wife and I. They serve a bread basket with two styles of bread. Pepper cheese and a standard Italian with a harder crust. They were both so good I purchased a loaf of each on the way out. Price per loaf was only $4. No way they make profit on the Pepper Cheese Loaf. Best value in bread in quite some time. I will stop in for the bread whenever I am in the area. The Pepper Cheese I would rate a 9.5 out of 10. The Italian was as good as it gets. I am a Pizza snob and getting a good review from me is tough. I am so tough I do not review if I think its bad. There Pizza is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone remotely close to the place. I would ask for a little less sauce. I would call it almost NY Style. Slightly thicker crust. I asked the waiter if I should order it well done and he said order it as is. He was correct and it came out perfect.   The waiter and staff were excellent and they informed me that they do not even own a microwave."Yummy Yum, Let me get me some.  This place rocks!!! Went here with the wife and had a great dinner.  Portions are very generous and the food is delicious.  Be prepared to pay top dollar though for the entrees, but they are worth every penny!"Great restaurant. Had the Eggplant Parmesan and it was very good. Bradley was our server and he was on top of things all the time. Prices are reasonable and the decor is inviting. Can't wait to go back."One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh!  Reasonable prices & delicious food.  Only one weird quirk - they don't bring the delicious fresh bread until you order - but it is complementary (sometimes they will if you ask nicely, but it doesn't come automatically). "Everything is super fresh - my friends & I always order a salad or two as a starter (they are huge & don't offer side portions) - I strongly recommend the panzanella salad.  "Then, any of the pastas. Seriously, they are all good!  ""If you remember to save room for dessert - the cakes are all GIANT!  Definitely enough to share (probably with a large table).""""I have never posted to Yelp before, but in light of the very unpleasant experience had by our friend Katie, I figured I'd share a happier one. I LOVE the food, the prices are great and I think I'm addicted to their cheesesteaks! The staff is always funny and down to earth, they make delivery to my job speedy, and they even deal with my indecisiveness! (haha). If something was wrong with my food, I am sure they'd waste no time fixing the problem."I always order a side of fries as they're HUGE and taste like Potato Patch (Kennywood) UHH-MAY-ZIIING. I would and do DEFINITELEY recommend Capri Pizza***PLEASE NOTE***" I do not stand in opposition to Katie, I really am sorry to hear of the unhappy experience, but I will say that I really do like Capri and I appreciate their staff.""""Friendly staff, same starbucks fair you get anywhere else.  Sometimes the lines can get long."Great location!  Close to shops and theatre.  Nice staff."This Starbucks is 5-Star Friendly. The shift supervisor Lucious keeps the energy in there moving and light. He recently helped me with a merchandise return and embodied everything a good manager and all around mensch person should - patience, kindness, generosity and fairness. I left that afternoon loving Starbucks even more than when I went in. It's great that a company and their employees can be as loyal to their customers as their customers are to them.""I am always so pleased with the customer service here. For such a tiny Starbucks, the do a really great job serving the masses that come in there and still manage to take the time to be friendly in the midst of the frenzy. ""Outdoor seating in the summer is nice.""""It's yet another Michael's, and it's a very good one. Recommended always. For those who love crafting, Michael's is a godsend.""Love this store!  Don't always have much luck with the sales, but I always find something I like here.  This isn't your average Marshall's or TJ Max.  I think the green dress I'm wearing is from Filene's!"Had a great time at Sing Sing a while ago with friends.  Friendly staff.  Will return."Piano Man to the tune of Gangster's Paradise...what more do I have to say? Get there early if you want a seat, $7 cover and really fun crowd. We had sucha great time and I can't wait to go back.""SingSing!!! What a blast! One of my favorite places to jam on Earth!! Cool bar, cool town, cool people... What else do you need!! The piano players are great, funny, semi-good lookin'... I mean dude, you gotta go!!! :) Love me some SingSing!""If you want to be wowed by musical talent and want to laugh all night, go to Sing Sing :) If you send a dollar up with a song request, they will play it. If they don't know it, they will ask for the person who put the request in so they can sing something else they like, or they will look up the lyrics and sing it!! They aim to please :) I have definitely been pleased :)""Sing Sing is awesome!! Give a buck or more and they will play anything, and if they don't know it, they will search for who requested the song so they can do something else the person will enjoy! :) Great humor too!! :)""What a great time!  This place was awesome!  I wish I lived right down the road, because I could see myself being a regular here.""Honestly, these guys have got some talent, like real talent.  They can play the piano, sing, play guitar, and the drums.  Did I mention that they are all pretty hilarious, too.  I'd easily pay the $7 cover to get in here any day because it really is worth it.  ""I am sure I will be back in no time at all.  Next time, I am bringing a big group of friends."""Went here for the first time this past weekend. Needless to say I'll be returning! It was a blast!!!"It was cheap to get in and since we got there a bit earlier we got a semi-good table. Though it was very annoying that people had reserved tables right up front and never showed up. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE?! Everything if you ask me! Seriously though if you're going to reserve a table, you better freaking go! ""I had no complaints about the place itself! The guys were hilarious and watching my brother get made fun of multiple times was just the cherry on top! Anddd this has to be the only place I've ever enjoyed being around people who were sloppy drunk, because the comedians take no prisoners! ""I did enjoy when Matt and Joey were the ones up there because they are just amazing and make it so much better! They are great at what they do. Can't wait to go back!""""Went for my 25th birthday and had a blast! Servers are great, the show was hilarious and had the whole crowd involved. Only bad thing is it can get very expensive!""What a great time! The pianists are funny, talented, and just a tad crude. But just enough to be funny.""Stopped in at Sing Sing to have a few drinks and hang out with some friends. The entertainment was fun. The guys do a great job singing, playing the instruments, and keeping the crowd pleased. Sing Sing is attached to The Rock Bottom Brewery so they have house beers. I did have the sampler and I enjoyed all six beers I sampled. What a great place to hang out. I highly recommend.""I brought my car here in 2006 for repair of a scratched bumper.  The damage was minimal, but the work required removing my entire bumper for repainting.  The staff were very helpful in explaining my options and presenting me with a few choices to get the most bang for my buck.  They completed the work in the quoted amount of time and did a great job.  A few weeks later, I noticed a spot that needed touched up and they handled it immediately and without question.  I would definitely recommend these guys if you need bodywork or paint work done.""I was so pleased with the quality of customer service at this body shop, from the very first time I took my car in for an estimate to a couple months down the line when I got my car repaired (they still remembered me!). One thing I really like is that they always pick up the phone. You wouldn't believe how annoying it is when businesses don't do this during normal business hours. They're so personable and gave me an honest quote that I couldn't turn down because it was the lowest in town (I checked out 5 places). They just really made this process painless and smooth. I believe it's a family-run business, and boy does it show in their hospitality.""Fran and Jason were the ones that I worked with -- extremely knowledgeable and patient, especially with a customer like me who wants to make sure all the paperwork is thorough and calculations are accurate. Joe DiIorio's (with an """"i"""" not an """"l"""") Auto Body also works closely with Enterprise Car Rental down the street, so they came and picked me up. Those guys down there have a great relationship with this body shop as well and were really accommodating.""Overall, the quality of their work is amazing. I had a large dent on the driver side front bumper and had to replace my light (they ended up getting an OEM light instead of the aftermarket one because it didn't match) and get a brand new bumper. They blended the paint for me, washed, waxed, and vacuumed my car, AND their work has a lifetime guarantee. What can I say other than give my highest recommendation and hope other Yelpers can find this helpful, as this is how I found out about them.""""From my first phone call to Joe Diliorio's, I was impressed. Every staff member I spoke too was kind and eager to help. I was treated like an important client even though my car needed only moderate repairs from a low speed collision. I was able to bring my car in right away for an assessment of the damage. Joe Dilorio's took care of everything from that point on. They dealt directly with my insurance company, ordered the parts (even getting new parts instead of the used ones my insurance company wrote the estimate for, at no cost to me), and gave me a call when all the parts came in. I then brought my car back to them and they completed the repairs in a timely fashion. When I arrived to pick up my vehicle, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had vacuumed, washed, and waxed my car! Most importantly, the repair work was absolutely top notch. They masterfully blended the paint to match older parts with newer repair parts. My car looks even better than before the wreck!""If you don't want any hassle, want to be treated with respect, and want your car looking fantastic, give these guys a call!""-Adam"""Joe Dilorio's Auto Body Shop was so helpful when I needed to get windows replaced. The were able to give me a lower quote then competing auto body shops in the area. They were also incredibly friendly and a pleasure to do business with. I'm planning on taking my car here for all future auto needs."This place is amazing! I needed my car repaired after an accident and the guys here were so helpful. They set me up with a rental car as soon as I dropped my car off, repaired my car in a timely manner, detailed it for free, and their customer service was unbelievable!!! I can't recommend this place more!""I'm grateful to my insurance company for recommending Di Iorio's Auto Body Shop. After an accident, I needed some body work done as soon as possible. The other recommended shops wouldn't even make an appointment to see me for days. These guys fit me in that afternoon, and coordinated the rental too. Everyone I worked with was courteous and pleasant, and the work was done more quickly than expected. Moreover, they found ways to help save on the expense. The car came out looking better than before the accident -- a few days later, I noticed they had buffed out some scratches that weren't even part of the repair area. I will definitely be back next time I need auto repairs.""SO lucky to be referred to Joe DiIorio's after moving to Pittsburgh. It's really invaluable to have ""car guys"" that you trust. I could detail several experiences here (in comparison to other chain shops), but suffice it to say that they've always been honest, helpful, and fair.""You can find pretty good body work without too much trouble.  Finding a place that's friendly, prompt, and organized that ALSO does good body work is more difficult.  Joe Dilorio's delivers on all counts.  Highly recommended for the next time you -- or somebody else -- make a little mistake on the road.""Amazing repair service. I hit a really fat raccoon in the Appalachians (it was dark and rainy and I didn't see the poor thing until it was too late) while going fairly fast down a hill. The raccoon destroyed my front bumper, the grill, and my right fog light. Thankfully I had duct tape in my trunk. Anyway, once I got back to Pittsburgh, I called my insurance agent."My insurance referred me to DiIorios and I'm really glad they did! The staff was very friendly and helpful doing the estimate. They even set up a rental for me when I was having the car repaired. They kept me updated on the status of the car and were just really pleasant to work with the whole time."Hopefully I don't have to get any body work done on my car again anytime soon, but if I do, I know I'm going to take back to DiIorios."""Lowe's is my goto store for home improvement supplies. It's convenient and local to me. Customer service is always great and prices are fair. "My most recent experience with customer service was AMAZING. So a hose burst on my hot tub. Call repair guy or try to fix it myself? I gave it a go. Took pictures of the hose and fitting and headed to the plumbing section. I showed the gentleman the picture and asked for help. He didn't have exactly the fitting for a hot tub, but gave me what he thought would work. It did! Under $3 bucks later and all was a go! Winter came and it sprung a leak in same spot. My fault and maybe lack of strength to tighten fitting and frigid temps. Back to plumbing section. Same gentleman. Gave me the advice again and bam, fixed! ""THIS is what I want in customer service. Sadly, I cannot remember his name. (Bad customer on my part.) Thank you!!!""""Lowe's is my first stop for all of my home projects.   I am currently redoing door.  Lowe's has knowledgeable employees that offer advice to the DIYs as well as a stable of contractors to hire out the big jobs.   Returns are handled seamlessly,  who doesn't grab the wrong part?  Their garden section is great for Spring planting.  They have competatively priced appliances.  5% off with Lowe's credit card is also nice.  Having those large items delivered is a convenience. Their best asset is the expertise of the staff.  I frequently change mind on an original concept based on their input.   Highly recommended""The food here can actually be a little hit and miss, but I love the grilled cheese club with fries. I get it way too much. People make fun of me.""They have a ten dollar minimum for credit cards, fyi."""Awesome wings and pubgrub! Great beer selection and fun bartenders."Duke...the owner...is the man.  He's a true Pittsburgher and he loves everyone from Pittsburgh.  He looks like he'll beat you up but he's a softy with a big heart.  Look for the bald guy with the raspy voice and make friends...he'll hook you up.  He's also totally into the development of other Pittsburgh businesses and he hosts events for local startups.  Ask him for a tour of the old Eat n Park next door...I believe his intention is still to turn it into an incubator of sorts.  Fortunately, the bar is close enough to the waterfront that it's just far enough out of the ghetto...the crowd is certainly decent.  Definitely have some beers on the porch in the summer...especially in the rain (lower level is covered).  Very relaxing atmosphere.  I wish my company was located in the area so we could frequent Dukes more steadily (we're on the north side).  Still worth the drive to feel at home, have a good bite and some cold beers."If you want to know the people from Homestead/Munhall then Dukes is the place for you.  A locals favorite they've seen a lot of growth since I started going 10 years ago.   They have a great selection of beer but I think where they really shine is in the food department.  My favorite sandwich there is the Pinkerton and it's often hard to get anything else every time I go.  Pierogi Pizza is pretty good as well as there gigantic sampler platter that a party of 4 could eat together!  Dukes is also an awesome place to watch sporting events with their see it from any angle TV selections all around the bar.  Soups of the days are awesome (Potato soup yes please) and they have a excellent happy hour special that will save you a few dollars.  "I've always been treated with a welcoming vibe from the staff and I don't have any complaints."""I find it frustrating to read bad reviews about great bars and restaurants that are based on almost nothing. I eat and drink here about once a month and everything is great. I have eaten here around 50 times and never had a bad meal. Great draft and great service. This is the best bar in this area.Love dukes and love the food. I wish i could figure out the closing times or i wouldnt plan so many after work gatherings. Their food is amazing never had a bad meal and their prices are standard for crafts and actually pretty cheap for domesticI really don't see how anyone could give this place a bad review.  The food is fantastic and if it's not my belly luring me in then it's the awesome beer selection they have.  My suggestion for those who are leery to try dukes after reading other ridiculous reviews is just order what they have on special that night... Everything is good so you can't go wrong and it will most likely come out faster and hotter being that it's on special.  If not I could suggest other delicious things to eat but I don't feel like typing out the entire menu...They often switch the beers out so there is always a constant flow of different and unique craft beers on tap... They can also print you out a list of beers and their percentage so you know what you are in for! (Lol)"Anyhow I love this place, the owners, and the staff! I highly suggest it to everyone who likes good beer and good food!"""GREAT PLACE FOR A BIRTHDAY PARTY!  A FAMILY GATHERING!  A WORK RETIREMENT PARTY!  OR EVEN A DOUBLE-DATE!"A combination watering hole, great place to eat and great entertainment for adults! Adult games!"The Homestead (Pittsburgh) location of Dave & Busters is just one of the almost 50 locations across the country - from New York to Florida to California - - from Canada to Mexico.  "The Dave & Busters idea was conceived in Little Rock, Arkansas back in the 1970s. Two different businesses (one a popular watering hole & one a game & entertainment business) were right next door to each other. The two young owners were friends and quickly realized that combining their businesses made perfect sense. So they opened the first combined D & B in  . . . . no, not Little Rock, but Dallas! To this day there are no D & B's in Little Rock. Not sure what is up with that! But lots of other cities have been the beneficiaries of these two friends combining their businesses.""The one in Pittsburgh is the only one I have ever been to.  When I lived there, a group of friends and co-workers (and me, of course!)used to go there for Happy Hour & Power Hour . . . . at least once a week. We had a blast!  A great place to kick-back and let the worries of the work day melt away.""Wonder if they'll ever open one in Marin County, CA? Shucks!  Probably not. Not a Marin County scene, for sure. ""WHAT A BLAST IT WAS THOUGH! I miss going to D & B. They have all the classics, like billiards & shuffleboard, plus over 200 interactive & video games. A rechargable Power Card provides an easy way to access all the games.  "POWER HOUR is game HAPPY HOUR - - an entire hour of classic and video games for just  ten bucks.  "A GREAT BAR, WONDERFUL FOOD AND SERVICE! A RELAXING AND FUN WAY to spend a Friday or Saturday evening. You'll never want to leave. Meet your friends here, grab a beer and a burger or steak and hit the games. ""Time will just evaporate . . . . while you laugh and drink with your favorite girl, your best friend or even your boss!  "DAVE & BUSTERS! LOTS OF PARKING! LOTS OF FUN!"FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! . . . . BRING ON THE BEER!""""Dave and busters is the best place to eat and play games. There is many fun games and prizes to win. I highly suggest if you want to plays games, go Wednesday when all the games are half off. Food is pretty good and a nice bar. The downside is that the booze is pretty pricey."I love it!  Love it!Dave & Busters is a great experience  if you set your expectations realistically and carefully choose when you attend.The main squeeze and I always 1) use a survey receipt for buy $10 get $10 in free gameplay or 2) Attend on a Wednesday during the day (flexible work schedules). We'd never dream of eating there because we like healthy yuppie food. And we only drink cheap drafts OR drink cocktails during happy hour."Your visit is largely determined by time of day, expectations and whether or not you eat their food. If you come on a Friday night, the lines will be long. You'll pay $150 for the two of you to eat, drink and play for 3 hours and you'll be left with a very sour taste in your mouth."The staff is really excellent; any issue with a game not paying out tickets results in immediate help and extra tickets or a swipe for a different game from an employee. "Note the """"drinks are weak"""" reviews. Also notice it was people buying shots and ordering multiple drinks per person. That's typical white trash behavior. Bartenders here are savvy; they mirror the behavior of the guests. All of our drinks have been consistently strong and well put together because we're courteous and tip well. I have witnessed bartenders bypass tattooed, loud guests and address me and take my order first. This is rational, logical behavior. ""Also note the """"prize center games suck"""" comments. You're supposed to stack tickets over multiple visits and use them on a big prize. Like life, delaying gratification nets you bigger returns. Every other visit I've seen someone walk out with a video game system (Wii, Xbox360 and even a few Xbox One's). "The thing about Dave & Busters is the crowd changes depending on day of week and time of day. Sunday afternoon it's all families and Friday and Saturday night it's all drunk 20 somethings. The atmosphere changes and that's why the reviews are all over the place."This review is based on 8ish months of 1-3/monthly visits. Most visits are 5 stars, some are 4 stars.""Using survey receipts for Buy Ten Get Ten, avoiding Wednesday, Friday or Saturday evenings (and Sunday afternoon, families) and avoiding the food entirely and drinking cheaply, you'll have a great experience for $25-40/person.""I really enjoy the staff too, they split the difference between fun and professional. Special shout out to Riley, gave us info on possibly hosting a party there.""""There is good food, but a great spot to enjoy a few drinks & watch sports on the big screens. It's great for adult fun after 10pm. Great for a first date if you like to have a good fun & feel relaxed""After having a few 'less than memorable' trips to D&B in years past, my wife and I  decided to go back for a Pittsburgh Happy Hour Anniversary party this past Thursday.  Pgh Happy Hour is a facebook group of friends that like to check out new 'watering holes' every thursday and it's run by a guy that seems to party 24/7 while still holding down a very lucrative full time job.  ""Anyway- Pgh HH was celebrating an anniversary and chose D&B for the location.  The D&B staff set up the back 'pool room' with complimentary,  enormous spread of appetizers with dips and kept refilling them when they got low.  Our server, Carla, was very attentive and friendly- making sure we were aware of the specials and checking back often when our glasses got to the half way point.  The other server back there was working equally as hard but I never got the chance to get her name.  ""I had been here one other time for an organized happy hour for a past employer and remember very similar service but I never got the chance to give them any credit.  I think D&B is an awesome place when you need some space for your next event.""""First off, let me say that I find the people who usually work at Dave and busters usually don't care or seem to be angry and hate their job. A friend and I went here and found that a couple of the machines ran out tickets and someone was always there and happy to help. The staff went out of their way to make sure we had a good time. The manager Tony was very sweet and made sure everything was ok. Every staff member we talked to was extremely nice. This is by far the best Dave and busters I've had been to!"I always go there to either eat dinner or have drinks .never had a problem with the food or drink.sometimes i will play games there sometimes.the girls behind the counter are very nice even the one guy Brett is also nice.he works very hard from what i can see as well as the girls that work there . even the one girl behind the counter was dressed very nice.when i do go there they do know what i like to eat or drink. Although the restrooms should be cleaned a little more.Great games and prizes. Amazing food.great way to enjoy your day with your family!!! Super busy place."We had our reunion banquet last weekend at this D&B. It was the highlight of our gathering. The room was spacious, well-appointed with tables covered with black tablecloths and set up according to our specifications. The buffet was delicious. The manager, servers and bartender were enthusiastic and attentive. What a wonderful facility."Kids and adults loved the arcade games. The pool tables were a hit too. We appreciated the roomy dance floor for those who wanted to groove."In the months leading up to our event, special events representative Laura checked in regularly. She, Sean and the managers made sure that our experience was memorable and even added extra touches that made us feel special. Thank you, D&B, for a great experience.""""This is a high quality,clean and professional grooming shop. I feel very comfortable leaving my golden retriever with this groomer.  The focus is on clean and natural and not fancy perfumes and gimmicks.""The woman working who cut my 9 month old Schnauzer was wonderful! He was very matted, not to mention nervous for his first grooming, and she still managed to do a WONDERFUL job on him! I could not be happier, especially because the people at Petco claimed he needed to be completely shaven because they didn't have the time for it being it was a busy Saturday. Paws in the Family Pet Grooming actually cared and took the time with him and he because of that he got to keep his beard, his chest-fur, and the fur on his legs. He looks like a Schnauzer! I am so happy!"great job always!!! i highly recommend!!!! ;-)"mandy & randy ;-)"""I am a big fan of Rock Bottom.There are several dishes that are MONEY."Appetizer:  Seared Ahi, Spinach Artichoke Dip""Entree :      Fire Steak, Pub Tips or Chicken Fried Chicken."Desert :      Carrot Cake (to die for)Bar food:     Pizza or ball park pretzels.  Both of which are sprayed with brown ale.  "Half the menu is really good, the other half is great.  ""The beer is good.  Ask for the sampler!  They usually have a velvet and something on cask.  Ask for one of those if you are looking for something different.  They will also have a scotch ale, an IPA, whiskey stout or other specialty depending on the mood of the brewer (which, if its still Matt, the mood is GRUMPY).   If Andy is still working there, he is sure to please and Molly is great in the cocktail area."Head over to Sing Sing after dinner and its a wrap.I used to work there several years ago and I make it a point to hit every RB I possibly can."Don't go to the one in Charlotte though, its not really a Rock Bottom."""I love this place!  Great atmosphere and friendly service every time I go!!"I would have to say I'm pretty partial to Rock Bottom, I have been going almost every Thursday for the past 3 years because of the fantastic ""Team Trivia"". My friends and I love the atmosphere, the DJ (Todd), and the service that we get at Rock Bottom. ""Every week when we go a menu is never needed because we pretty much know everything we want on it, except for when the change the menu from time to time and we get to have a special treat with something new! ""As an avid Rock Bottomer, hands down I have never in my life had a better spicy spinach cheese dip than I have had here at Rock Bottom. Whether I have eaten dinner or not before I come down to the restaurant, my favorite and my food of choice is the ENORMOUS Ball park pretzels with the cheese dip. It is a meal itself! The mixture of onions, cheese, spinach and tomatoes is perfection! ""Another favorite of mine is the Barbecue Chicken Pizza, it has a great kick to it and it's big enough for two people. "The service has always been super great and now since we go often we have developed a great relationship with some of the wait staff. A truly great place to have fun with friends and meet new people! "Come to Team Trivia every Thursday at 8pm!"""Fish tacos were excellent!! Great brewed beers on tap as well!!!!!!Southwest Egg rolls and Fish tacos. Mmmmmmmmm. Ohh and the AMAZING Brews!My husband and I got here a couple times a year.    Always (except my veggies today) get great food at a decent price.   I love their side salad..... which has raisins and sunflower seeds.    Burgers are great and my husband loves their chicken Mac and cheese.   Recommend to everyone just get there early for a seat."On a glorious day in the month of May , my love and I stumbled hungrily into rock bottom.  Ha. Just kidding I realized Darren W. Hadn't reviewed here so I had to start it cheesy.  ""The rock bottom line: Monday for lunch we had awesome service by Ashley.  We weren't rushed and it was quite.  The burgers were great and half off . The beer was very good.  We will be returning for sure.""""Planned a surprise birthday party here for my wife and they did an amazing job helping to pull it off! Service was extremely helpful, professional, and on point all night. Lauren (one of the managers) was reliable and pleasant throughout the entire planning process. If anyone is looking to plan an event I would highly recommend Rock Bottom. Couldn't be happier!""I love this restaraunt. Rarely have I ever received service like I get here. The food is good, definitely reasonable for the price. The thing that blew me away was the fact that my steak was cooked TO TEMPERATURE. This rarely ever happens at restaraunt of similar price range and quality. But the servers are fantastic. Very attentive, polite and timely. The beer selection is awesome, we always order the sampler. I like having lots of options as far as beverages go. The wait time isn't terrible if you go a little later on a friday or Saturday night. And they most often call you before the quotes time. The desert menu is a little small, but I could probably skip it anyways ;)  the ambiance is good, not to crammed or noisy. They also have outside seating available when the weather is nice I highly recommend this establishment!"I love this place! Great food and the best beer brewed on site! The bourbonzola burger is the best thing you can order here.BALL PARK PRETZEL-Would eat again. "I came to rock bottom, looking for a great beer. Full of hops, that brings a refreshing sensation and satisfaction. I then opened the menu, scanned looking for those select bar items to pair with my great beer. I saw an extensive list of items, from chicken fingers to salads. I noticed a Ball Park Pretzel, with a jalapeÃ±o cheese dip. I was blown away, the fact that I got 2 pretzels amazed me. I ordered within 25 minutes of seating. My pretzels hit the table within minutes. The smell of the warm salt and hot cheese opened my senses. But I knew we could step this shit up, I asked for mustard. And what do you know. Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard is in front of my eyes. I combined that shit and life evolved. I went to heaven, it took me 35 minutes to write this review because I took a solid bite with Grey Poupon after each sentence. Good look Rock Bottom, keep up the good work.""""I love Rock Bottom. I don't frequent the restaurant side of RB as much as I do SingSing, but the food comes from RB. I order practically the same thing every time (Bacon Mac 'n Cheese, Brewery Nachos, and a beer...usually an IPA or a Manhattan) and the last two times I was at RB, the food was disappointing: it was cold and unappetizing, my Manhattan sucked, and the service was worse. The food is always better over at SingSing for some reason...even if they do come from the same place! ""I was craving the Mac 'n Cheese, so I went down to pick some up. I had a gift card, so I figured I wasn't out any money if the food sucked. I saw that there was a new menu, so I sat down to order. I got the Street Food Quesadilla, Bacon Mac 'n Cheese, and Beer Battered Onion Rings. I also ordered a Homemade Root beer and a few samples of the house beer."Everything was amazing! It came out hot and tasted awesome. They have a new Head Chef and it shows. I was floored...the new Street Food options are fun and tasty. They are unique and different...not something you'd find at any restaurants in the area."The Service was good. My waitress was named Liz and she certainly was on point. She even helped me find a beer after I was sorely disappointed by the IPA offering...which was weird. I always thought the House Brews were tasty and fun, no matter their style or make. I'm an IPA girl, but I would happily drink anything that came from their taps. I was disappointed in the offerings, but I ended up settling on the Pale Ale that was quite tasty.""In the end, if you were turned off by Rock Bottom before, I'd definitely recommend going back to check out the Street Food and new menu offerings. Service has dramatically improved, food quality has improved,  and I was thrilled.""""The food is always plentiful, the atmosphere lively, the service friendly, and even though it's always busy, I rarely have to wait for a table. ""If you're a nachos fan, this is the place! Often, I just make it my appetizer, salad, and meal. Yes, it's that big. ""Even though I'm not a big beer drinker, I enjoy their sampler, and I LOVE their cider; it had just the right amount of kick.""""I'm visiting Homestead this week for some work-related training.  Rock Bottom was recommended by the receptionist at my hotel, and I'm so glad it was!  I've been there twice already and will go back before I leave in a few days.  I sat at the bar during both of my visits, and the bartenders were both very nice...Bob during the day and Paul at night.  The pumpkin beer and milk stout are both awesome.  Like other reviewers stated, the nachos are great!  I think the best part was that everyone was very friendly.  Other customers seated at the bar were eager to chat, which is so nice when you don't know anyone in the area!  Great place!  Thanks for the hospitality!""We stopped in to grabs bite to eat before we went to Improv. My wife and I got the bacon chicken mac&cheese. It was absolutely delicious right down to the last bite. We raved about it all night long. Our friend got a burger and asked for it well done. It came out medium. So she sent it back. The manger brought out the new one and he took care of our friends check. Pretty great service. She loved the burger, and said it was one of the best she has had. "I had the beer sampler and I liked all six beers. They were good. "I would recommend this place and if we are down that way I will definitely go back."""Great selection of beers especially the seasonal ones! You won't be disappointed. The JalapeÃ±o pretzels are dope!"I have a little bit of mechanical knowledge, but not enough to land me a job as a mechanic. I try to do a good bit of my own work to save on the repair bill and to avoid unscrupulous mechanics. ""I called a handful of shops to get a quote to replace an exhaust manifold gasket and bolts on my 05 Grand Cherokee. Alan (owner) quoted me $250 per side (I have the 5.7 V8, so there are 2 sides) to fix it. Sure enough, it was $250 out the door. Alan is a great guy that knows his stuff. If it doesn't need to be fixed, he'll tell you it doesn't need to be fixed. BUT, if it does need to be fixed, it really does need fixing. He even checked on a couple of other things and made some recommendations for other specialty shops for projects I plan on doing on this Jeep, which he didn't have to do. ""I chose to give Master a shot after my normal go-to shop in Monroeville didn't return my call seeking a quote for the exhaust manifold. Some of the reviews on Google for Master are unfair, with the chief complaint being a misunderstanding of personalities. If you want to question what the mechanic tells you needs to be done, fine. Just make sure you know what you're talking about. If you have zero mechanical knowledge, don't tell the mechanic how to do their job. Alan won't blow smoke up your dress and hold your hand. If you want your car fixed, take it to Master. ""Thanks again, Alan, for giving me the opportunity to boast on the Jeep forums about only paying $250 for a repair that many have shelled out $1K+ to fix! You're my new go-to shop for our vehicles. ""(If you're curious as to their hours, I was there a little after 7AM. They are first come, first serve.) Don't be an idiot and expect your car to be fixed 5 minutes after pulling into the lot. Oh, and don't park in front of the garage doors like a tool!""""Great night out.  I don't know if Christopher Titus set the ticket price or the club did, but at $25 a ticket, we will be going back often.  Great line up of top name acts coming to town.  extremely nice staff. highly recommend."This is the best Giant Eagle in the area and is the most like grocery stores in Bay Area. Here's why:1. They sell beer!2. Huuuuuge produce selection"3. Natural/organic foods section: cereal, pasta, soups, etc and fancy chocolate bars""4. Long isle of ethnic foods includes mexican, indian, italian, asian and , of course, jewish""5. Functioning bakery with fresh, appetizing breads and desserts (I am still loyal to Allegro Hearth though)""The store is huge and I haven't been to all of it yet but they also have nicer flowers, balloons, home/seasonal section, DVD rentals and a photo center as well as a drive-through pharmacy. ""It seems as this GE just might be the answer to my grocery stores woes.""""Probably the most comprehensive supermarket in the county, if not all of southwestern PA. Its selection is considerably larger than what you can find in most Giant Eagles, and it has more upscale items. I live an easy walk from the Swissvale Giant Eagle, but I often drive to this location for the superior selection.""This is easily one of the best Giant Eagles I've ever been to. Huge. Very nice selection. Easily comparable to Whole Foods. Went to their cheese market, and was pleasantly surprised with the selection. I got Beemster Vlaskas, an amazing Gouda. Very large parking lot.""I have to thank the bakery, once again for getting me out of a jam! Twice, Bekka, has made a great cake for my daughter when party planning was at its stress point! Her guest interaction is very professional and she always makes everything seem easy and manageable without a ripple. Thanks again Bekka!!""This is a great supermarket!  All of the staples.  Great deli, market square and bakery.  Fresh produce and extra convenient to have vegetables and fruits cut and packaged.  Love the fact that I can shop, drop dry cleaning, and pick up pharmacy items in one stop.  Close to other shopping and wonderful restaurants."Such nice staff.  I really lament the decline of the modern bookstore.  I really enjoy browsing and picking up a new book.  The store has a great selection and the staff are always helpful and kind.  "I really hope this store stays here for some.  The prices are also fair and often have great discounts.""""I find this location, clean and well organized, but that's not the reason it's getting 5 stars! "I called today to look into whether or not their May issues of magazines were out (I need them for my job) and Erin so kindly went checked on every single magazine I asked about! Now that is customer service! "Well done, well done!"""There is nothing like a book and no better place to find one than a book store. "This Barnes and Noble carries on a long history of excellence. They always have an extensive selection and a friendly staff that is willing to find what ever book you are seeking."""$1 burger night on Tuesday. Add ons more."I'm surprised by the low reviews. I am a regular here. Perhaps it is a little bit pricey, and that is the concern. But, it seems like everything is pricey these days. Their pretzel appetizer is -fantastic- hot, fresh pretzels with sauces. I also regularly get their grilled vegetable wrap, with broccoli instead of fries, or their salad wedge. ""They've got nice outdoor seating with great fire ornaments, but, well, it is outdoors.""In the past, service was really bad. I quit going for a while, after having to """"Do the wave' for a check. But, for the last 2-3 years, it has been really good. I've found the staff to be professional, attentive, responsive, and friendly. Maybe these are old reviews?""""One of my favorite places, and they have thee Best Lemon Drop Martini's... Plus the Bar Tender looks like Clark Kent(Superman) very handsome guy""Great atmosphere and rather humble, especially for a chain restaurant. The service is always friendly, even if they are busy. I enjoy taking clients out for drinks there because of the enjoyable bartenders and wide array of drinks on their menu. I highly recommend their chicken sliders and you have to try their tempura shrimp. ""Be sure to make a reservation because they can get busy too!"""Best place for a late dinner. They have a pretty diverse and interesting  menu. Kitchen is open til 2am. The atmosphere is very relaxing and staff is always pleasant."The place where my fiancÃ© and I first met. Went back for anniversary, mentioned it to server, and were given a free dessert to help us celebrate. Very, very cool Bar Louie! Love ya even more now! "Jerk shrimp lettuce wraps are so spicy hot they blew us away - extremely spicy - very good but caused us to order plain old soft pretzel to balance out the heat. "Buffalo chicken flat bread - great but hot too"""I LOVE Sandcastle. "First, let me say that I'm reviewing the waterpark, not the people. The park has little to no control over the people that visit the park and the way they or their children behave. ""If you are going to visit, I would HIGHLY suggest you try to go on a weekday. I've attempted to visit on nice weekends before when the park has actually been at capacity and they are no longer allowing people in. It gets CROWDED on the weekends, especially if the weather is nice. There aren't a ton of nice days in the summer in Pittsburgh, so when there are nice days, people come out in droves! ""The slides are a blast, the lines are sometimes very long, but worth it. The lazy river is great when it's not wall to wall people. I really enjoy the new Dragon's Den but the line is CRAZY long for it! They also have a fantastic bar area, we have gone a few times and enjoyed a festive beverage while we enjoy the sun!""They have several areas for smaller children, which are all fantastic. ""If you are visiting, trying to take advantage of the giant eagle discount tickets, because these can get really pricey. You can also do a Sandcastle/Kennywood ticket, where you visit Sandcastle during the day and Kennywood at night. It's a fantastic deal, but boy could that be exhausting!""""We went to the Sandcastle Waterpark this past weekend before we went to Heinz Field.  We are a family of four; Dad, Mom, 17 year old girl, and 8 year old girl.  We all enjoyed it.  There was plenty to do for everyone; wave pool, kiddie pools, single tube slides, double tube slides, and body slides.  It was a cloudy day in the upper 70's, so it wasn't crowded at all.  Check for coupons at Giant, Local Flavor, and other places.  Some things don't open until 12 PM, even when the park opens at 11 AM.  Parking is $6.00.""For some reason, I had a tremendous amount of anxiety about buying a new mattress. Maybe I was just self-conscious about rolling around on a bunch of beds in a public place. ""ABD Mattress quickly alleviated any idiotic fears I may have had. The store was empty when I arrived on a Monday afternoon and I was attended to immediately and never felt pressured. ABD has a great selection of mattresses, and the prices cannot be beat. I picked up a full plush pillow-top mattress for a cool $375 (without a box spring or a frame, since I already had one). Better yet? Delivery is free AND prompt. You pick a three-hour timeframe, and the store will call you on the day of delivery to narrow it to a one-hour slot so you're not sitting around all afternoon."""I'm a mattress buying novice. I also hate buying things that require you to try-before-you-buy. I also seem to give explanatory information about myself before reviews. Anyway. "I had a lot of anxiousness about buying a mattress. If it's terrible, you'll be spending a large proportion of your life in misery until you fix the problem. Who wants that? Especially for something that can be as expensive as a mattress? ""These people were great. They patiently answered all of my mattress questions and treated me like a valued customer - both times I called, the man on the phone remembered my name (and number!) and took care of me. When I failed to buy a box spring (why oh why did I think I could go without a box spring??) they were able to take care of me over the phone and get me a box spring in the SAME day. Within hours, even. They even helped me set up the mattress that I DIDN'T purchase from them, which blew me away. ""Their professionalism and friendliness are excellent. I will recommend them to everyone who's in the market for a mattress, especially students, because their student deals are fantastic."""The only place to buy a mattress."Both my wife and I and our daughter desperately needed new mattresses so I decided to check this place out. We went on a Sunday afternoon and were the only ones in the store. Lee greeted us and showed us around the store. They offer mattresses, recliners, dinettes, daybeds, bunk beds and bedroom furniture. We found her a great mattress at a great price. While waking around the store my wife found a Serta iComfort series mattress for us that felt like heaven to lay on. ""Lee had told us about their free 18 month no interest financing through Wells Fargo Bank, free bed frame, free delivery and set up of your new bed and free removal of your old mattress and box spring which made it a no brainer! I went in to only buy our daughter a new mattress but I bought us a new one as well. No one can beat their prices! I compared the price of our new mattress to Levin, Macy's and Mattress Discounters. No one came close to the price we got at American Buyers. Everywhere else was double the price for just our mattress not including our daughters so it was like getting hers for free." "Take it from me, when it comes to your sleep, DO NOT BUY A CHEAP MATTRESS!!! We bought a cheap, supposed Serta mattress in 2008 from Mattress Discounters. The boxed spring had to be replaced about 2 years after owning the bed. I don't think I will have that problem again as our new Serta has a full 25 year warranty. ""A couple days later our daughters mattress was delivered first and about a week later our new mattress was delivered. The delivery guys had our old mattress and box spring out and our new frame, box spring and mattress set up in less than 10 minutes.""I highly recommend American Buyers Discount Mattress for all of your bedding needs.""""This is the most reliable car service I have experienced in Pittsburgh. Amazing service. For the last four years, we have used them each week to pick up and drop off colleagues at the airport. They're always waiting by the Hertz counter, ahead of time, without fail. Even when the flight is early or had a 3 hour delay. They charge about $10 more than a yellow cab. If you have client you need picked up or dropped off at the airport, I would highly recommend First Class. ""My first time in Pittsburgh, when the driver heard I was on an interview, he even gave me a free tour of a few neighborhoods in the city."""I agree with the other reviewers. I tried these guys based on the Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. "I'm a grumpy New Englander, and have been frustrated by the small town, easygoing/careless customer service at many PGH businesses. These guys are different: professional, punctual (even in snow!).""""Great customer service.  I was in Pittsburgh for business and needed a car to get back to the airport.  I found these guys on Yelp, and the reviews were not wrong.  It was easy to order the car and pick-up was prompt.""Ditto everyone else. I had out of towners needing to get to the airport but I had a last minute work conflict and couldn't drive them. I was nervous about using one of the standard cab companies because their track record of actually showing up isn't great. I called these guys the night before an 8am pick-up and everything went smoothly. Dave even checked on their flight for us to make sure it was on time given bad weather. If you're planning on getting a cab to the airport, definitely use First Class.""After reading glowing reviews on Yelp, I decided to try this service to pick up my 83 year old mother and take her to the airport. Service was great. Driver was very courteous and on time. We used them to pick her up at the airport and are equally happy. The driver even carried her suitcases upstairs to her apartment."We always use First Class Limo for flights too early to take the 28X to the airport.  They even have a multi-pickup service for early flights if you are not in time for a regular reservation."Fabulous service all around. My husband was coming in on a redeye flight from San Diego around 9am on Saturday morning, and just before midnight on Friday, I realized I wasn't going to be able to pick him up. I called First Class Limousine Service around 12:30am and was pleasantly surprised that someone picked up. I ended up speaking to Dave, the owner, and he was able to accommodate my last-minute request. ""My husband initially went to the wrong meeting place (on account of his sleep deprivation :) so the company called me asap when he didn't show up right away--I reminded hubby about the correct meeting spot and all went well after that. He was very happy with the service and the price. I'd definitely use this company again for rides to and from the airport! Thanks everyone!""""Excellent service! The driver was first class! Truly was the best car service I have ever experienced. Driver was classy, professional and kind. Great reservation service and very fair price. Do yourself a favor-skip the cab and call this car service. Reliable, professional and great value. Thank you!""I'm not sure what it is about this place that I love so much. I have been eating here for probably 10 years now, and it NEVER disappoints. Its not fancy, its not unique, its not some fantastic restaurant, its a chinese takeout place. But it is delicious! Everything I have ever ordered is good. The general tsos, the chicken with broccoli, the beef with broccoli, the sweet n sour, the teriyaki, etc. etc. But the real treats are the egg rolls and the wonton soup. Their lunch specials are all six or seven bucks and are more than enough food for a big guy like myself. It is also always ready in 10-15 minutes.""Affordable, fast, and delicious.""""Everyone's been to Fridays I am sure, but I enjoy the Yucatan Salad it's delicious. My children love Fridays it's usually there 1st choice. I also love the Cajun Chicken & Shrimp Pasta very very good.""While visiting relatives in Somerset we decided to go shopping in the nearby town of Homestead.  My aunt insisted that we have lunch at Uno's Pizzeria & Grill as the food was delicious.  When we arrived I had to admit that I was impressed with the decor and atmosphere of the place.  It was fairly crowded for a weekday but we were seated in less than ten minutes.  The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu answering all our questions with ease.  I settled on a Turkey, Bacon and Avocado sandwich and old fashioned tomato soup after looking over the menu several times.  They have a variety of dishes guaranteed to please all ages.  The food arrived in no time and was DELICIOUS!  The portions were just right for lunch, I was definitely ready for an afternoon of shopping.  The four of us had items off the Two for U lunch menu, our bill was less than $30 which meant that I might could afford the shoes I wanted to buy!  My aunt was right, you cannot visit Homestead without stopping to eat at Uno Pizzeria & Grill, it is FANTASTIC!!""It gets 5 stars cause it jogs up a memory. Back before Pizza Hut turned into a fast food restaurant, the Pizza Hut my grandfather used to take me to was a really nice restaurant. And this location has the same look and feel as the old pizza hut before it went take out. "So this is the old style pizza hut. Very family orientated dining style. You can sit here for hours. And so we did. We had a heap of use in a long table.I ordered one of the small pizzas which were buy 1 get one free. Disappointed in the selection of that. Seeing other choices... I regretted going on the cheap. "Prices are moderate. 12 for a little pizza... but with all the dough, you get full. Can't say I walked away hungary. Nor did I finish my second mini pizza. ""I want to come back and get that spanich fetta looking pizza!""""I would write anthems, poems, novels about their pizza. ""I've dreamed of their pizza since I was a child. My only encounter with my beloved Uno was when my mother came home with a take out box that she ordered for lunch that day.  I would scarf down the thick wedges of pizza and greedily pick off the loose toppings from the box. The cold 4 hour old pizza has since plagued my mind.  I desperately tried to find an Uno but found that the nearest one had closed down. CLOSED DOWN. My dreams were crushed, my psyche disturbed. I had become a changed person. I wanted more. I needed more. My mother stopped coming home with Uno take out boxes. I stopped eating pizza. I hated the flimsy crusts that were just cheap variants from my beloved Uno, I despised the New york style that you could so easily fold. Feh, I would resign from eating pizza till I had my precious. My precious, my Uno deep dish. ""It wasn't until that fated day when I drove past an Uno. The neon lights called out to me, it was like seeing heaven for the first time. I stumbled into the Uno. Dazed, the smell was like nothing I had ever experienced on this green Earth.  There was nothing I could compare it too. I sat down and ordered the Numero Uno with a side of fries.  """"No not personal...Regular."""" I wanted the entire thing, not just a wedge of a dream. I wanted the whole thing. ""It came out, steaming. Bubbling. Oozing. Fresh. So fresh. I took a bite - the cheese was perfectly melted. And then another - the dough was so thick and tasteful. And then another - ooh that sausage..."Until there was nothing left. I had achieved my dream. But I will be back for more. I will be back..for my precious. "But the fries were mediocre.""""I love this particular LOFT store! Everything is nicely set and the atmosphere is relaxing. The quality of clothes is really good and I do believe it's good value for money. They usually have more chic and classic clothes which I love. The staff is exceptional here. I love that they are really trying to help finding the right clothes for you instead of telling you ""how beautiful everything looks on you"". I always feel welcomed and I really do appreciate the fact that I am not being approached by a staff member every two minutes (this unfortunately happens in a lot of other stores in this area). This store feels more personal. Combine that with quality and affordable clothes and happy staff members and you definitely have a new regular customer!"Any place that accommodates with a special dietary menu for a little known disease gets five stars from me.  P.F. Chang's has a dedicated Gluten-Free Menu for those of us who suffer from celiac disease.  They also make sure to clean down the area they prepare the specialty dinner so as to avoid cross-contamination.  I don't know many other restaurants that go this far."Aside from the menu preference, I enjoy my overall experience every time.  Their menu is a bit different than that of what most people will be used to if you regularly eat a Chinese Take-Out or Buffet joints.  Don't expect this to be at all like that.  It's not a Buffet.  They don't sell """"General Tso's"""" (though Chang's Spicy Chicken is recommended for those looking for something similar, it's my personal favorite) or other signature foods that you may expect.  They do sell very similar items with different names and a few of their own adjustments, just make sure to read the menu description and ask questions if you are not sure.  They also sell Sake, I believe they have a few different types.  "The prices can get a bit more expensive than your average Chinese Restaurant depending on what you get but it's well worth it.  Portions are excellent and the taste is great.  I've yet to have one complaint and I have frequented this establishment several times over the span of a few years."The only downside, it can be a little crowded and a bit loud.  It's also very dark because of their lighting.  However, I think it sets the atmosphere.  It can be a romantic place or a casual place, I've been there for both."""We recently went here for a group dinner with friends.  I am unable to eat gluten and my server (Denice) was knowledgable and brought me special sauces as not to irritate my allergies.  She was amazingly accommodating and when my meal was too spicy (which was totally my fault) she got me something else.  I had the GF beef with broccoli and it was amazing.  She was personable and friendly and went beyond expectations to make sure our table enjoyed themselves.  We were there for a while and were all on separate checks.  I've been to eateries before where that was treated with great disdain.  Never once did I feel unwelcome.  I will go out of my way to eat here again."Great food, great atmosphere, little on the loud side but they have turned down the music since the last time we were here so it's much better, good service."I will say make a reservation since it's pretty busy on a weekend!  We got seated quickly with a reservation.  Our server was excellent despite how busy it was.  He was also helpful with recommendations and let me sample a couple wines before picking a bottle.  The manager was also great.  We weren't in love with one of the dishes and the manager came out and talked to us about what we were looking for and gave us a complimentary order of what he recommended.  I will say this - they know how to treat their customers. We'll definitely be back :)"Our family loves this restaurant.  My children and I suffer from food allergies.   I have Celiac's Disease and their gluten free selection for a Chinese restaurant is great.  My children are a completely different ball game.  They have a rare disease called Eosinophilic Esophagitus where food attacks their body.  They are very limited on their food selctions due to not being able to consume any food with gluten, soy, eggs, dairy, nuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, amd corn.  This restaurant takes special care of my kids by making sure they get chicken that has not gone through the egg wash.  The servers and managers are all trained in how to be careful.  Our favorite manager is Joe and favorite server is Kevin.  Call ahead if you have any questions and they will answer your questions."This place hit the spot. Stopped here before a movie and ate at the bar. We got just what we wanted: quick service and some good eats. "I recommend the fried green beans with aioli  -- soooo good! Who knew I liked green beans?! And this trip I tried some sushi and got the spicy tuna roll. Although it was clearly not pieced together by an expert sushi chef, it was extremely fresh and delish (so who cares if it's not beautiful?!)""""Good food, good service, and always an enjoyable visit. They forgot to put in our appetizer order but threw it in for free to make it up to us. A good place to catch a meal if you're down around the waterfront.""I used to work here!  Haha, many moons ago tho.  Usually you leave a restaurant job sick of the food and the people but even after I left I still love going in and talking to the staff and getting something to eat and drink and just hanging out.  "I'm a Changs Chicken junkie and I can't stay away from it for too long.  The bartenders have always been some of the best I've ever seen no matter how many changes they've gone through and this is one of the few places where even years and years later the same people work and still love it!  Says a lot about the people.  "Changs Chicken, Chicken Lettuce Wraps and Pork Won Tons though are the standard fare are always amazing.  Some other excellent dishes are Kung Pao Chicken, Shrimp Dumplings, Mongolian Beef and The Ahi Tuna.""It might be a chain restaurant but this one is one of the strongest links in the chain!"""Thank you so very very very much to the management Hallie.  She literally helped me with immediately with an error that was on my gift card.  Also Hallie visited our table during our meal to see if everything and everybody was okay." Also our server, Aaron, was really helpful and sweet.  I am a very very picky eater.  I don't like onions, garlic, peppers, mushrooms, broccoli, rice, etc.  Aaron was awesome in his help as I selected my food.   ""Very rarely do  I eat dessert.  I love their  pineapple coconut ice cream.  There banana sprung rolls are good, but the ice cream is to die for.  The two come together.""""This is largely a review for Sean, a managing partner at this location. I had gone to this location while in town with my family for the holidays, looking for a non-cooking escape before getting inundated with guests. A few of us ordered the lunch special with soups, my mom had ordered the butternut squash ravioli, and we also got an order of street noodles and started with summer rolls. Everything was great (the street noodles in particular are fantastic), but the service was a bit of a disaster- dishes came out more than 10 minutes apart from each other, a huge mood killer with a big family meal; a few dishes came out dirty; soups didn't come out at all; and our waitress made up excuses and didn't apologize when she had in fact missed some of our orders. We were feeling really ignored and discouraged, until we let Sean know. He took great care of us and went way, way out of his way to make up the experience. I really can't thank Sean enough for making sure we left in a good mood after what could have been a very negative experience. Heaven knows that a positive tone is ESSENTIAL going into the holidays with family!""Gordons in the Waterfront is exactly what I needed for new shoes after I was allowed to walk again after a fracture in my foot.  The man who waited on me was kind, patient, and even let me know about a sale going on.  The selection and quality of shoes is wonderful.  You won't get cheap shoes here but you will get the best. Worth every cent."Extremely helpful staff that knows exactly what shoes are comfortable yet stylish. The shoes I bought were high quality and durable. I was extremely impressed by the staff."This is by far my favorite Panera location in the Pittsburgh area. Friendly, plenty of room to sit, and good quality food & coffee. Panera is a great place to hang out and read the news - they even have free WiFi! Try their toasted sandwiches, especially the chicken bacon dijon.""Amazing amazing place and I really enjoy to eat there and drink the prices they not high, very good service and fast .""Panera is one of our family's favorite restaurants. Everything is great. Kids love bagels and chicken noodle soup. Adults usually order ""you pick two"". Sandwiches, salad are all very good."I only allow my dogs to go to Dr. Bezak. I've had a couple Chow Chow's who a lot of vets are afraid of. Doc had a Chow himself so knew what to look out for in the breed. He has taken good care of them over the years.OMG. Target is my fav store ever. I love the staff they are also so helpful and friendly. They recognize me being there quite often!!! I also greatly appreciate being able to use a target coupon AND a manufacture coupon!!!!!  I save so much money shopping  there and now I save 5% everyday using my target debit card!!!!! Ah I love this store!!!!!!!"OK I know what you're thinking - You're a chick!  Why are you rating MEN'S Wearhouse?!  Well recently the BF and I went shopping for some business friendly clothes for him.  Our ""wardrobe expert"" (and I feel terrible because I forgot his name) was incredibly friendly and helpful that I couldn't help but think - WHY DON'T THEY HAVE STORES LIKE THIS FOR WOMEN!!?  Someone who helps you - no matter your size or height, finds you the pants that fit your body, the dress shirts, the jackets, etc.  This man was absolutely STELLAR!  Incredibly personable and he knew his job well.  The BF left with exactly what he needed and I may or may not have talked him into a few other items... What can I say, I like a sharp dressed man (cue ZZ Top).  So if you're looking to make your man a little more stud-ly with a jacket, tie, dress shirt, or perhaps a full suit, stop by Men's Warehouse.  You'll be drooling over him in no time ;)""I went in to get my suit that I bought last year tailored because I had lost some weight and I couldn't have had a better experience. When I walked in I was immediately created by Bill who was warm and friendly. Anna came out to perform the measurements and mark up the suit. She checked everything, even changes I hadn't thought to have made to make sure the suit fits me perfectly when they are done. Best of all, when I asked if they could ship the suits to me at my house since I no longer live in Pittsburgh, they asked when I was leaving town and promised they would get it done for me before I left  the next day. Better yet, they had the suit ready for me early, avoiding the rush for me to pick it up before I left. Everyone was extremely helpful and diligent and I will continue to only get changes done at this store.""When I go to other pizza places I ask myself ""will this be as good as Pizza Companies pizza""?.  ""I don't understand how this place hasn't gotten Papa Johns big cause rarely do I get a pizza or a sandwich that's inconsistent with the last one I got.  The Steak Untouchables though not Primantis, is the close runner up for my favorite """"sandwich with everything on it"""".  The hoagies are never soggy and this might seem like a small thing but they use shredded lettuce.  I hate when you go somewhere and it's just regular ripped off the head lettuce, not this place.  I do think it's a little expensive but I've watched the prices go up with the economy and their popularity so I'm sure it's justified.  ""Side tip, go in and get a slice of Pizza, it's a little different than their whole pizzas you order.  It's really good.""Oh yeah, be sure to ask for Longfellow Bones, he's a cook there and a hell of a rapper.  Tell him HITTofMCM sent you.""""I've been coming to this DSW approximately every other month over the last year. The Waterfront is my go-to place when I need to do mindless wandering and shopping, and this store has been added to my regular itinerary. ""I came here on Friday night needing to zone out and to just try ridiculous amounts of shoes for fun. I headed back to the clearance (unusual for me!) and wow, what a selection! Seychelles summer wedges for $14... Minnetonka suede booties for $50... Both the styles and the prices were spot on! I ended up purchasing a pair of Audrey Brooke summer wedges for $12 along with some Nina silver """"wedding"""" pumps for $30. What bargains!""However, I'm not writing this review update to just talk about fab shoe finds and great deals...  ""The first several times that I shopped here, customer service was dismal (as mentioned in my previous review). However, the last couple times I've been here, I've seen associates as soon as I walk through the door and been quickly offered assistance. This is a significant difference from what I experienced in the past, and I just had to recognize this store for making positive changes! ""Keep up the good work - and the great assortment - and I'll be back often!"""This is the best location of the best restaurant in the world. I visit Eat'n Park every chance I get when I come from out of town. I regularly have cravings for this place even after moving out of state years ago."The workers here are extremely friendly, and the inside is absolutely beautiful.  There is also a playful statue of the famous smiley mascot for people to see and take pictures with it!  Kids love smiley and so do I!  They have so many great items on the menu to choose from that I have trouble deciding!""This company represents a honest and caring company that cares about their community.  They operate a variety of businesses and restaurants including the Eat n Park locations, the new Porch in Shenley, Six and Penn Kitchen, and the new upcoming Hello Bistro.  I cannot wait to try all of their dinning places."Fow what it is this eat n park really is a lot better then i remember. I also really like and approve of them offering healthier lower calorie option that have some variety and taste good.Great location!  I love that you can substitute burger with a veggi patti and that they have gluten free bread.  Love love love the smiley cookies :)"This TJ Maxx is quickly becoming a weekly stop for me! The corporate team is definitely giving this store a lot of love with the product that they receive. Lately, I haven't been able to go into this store without spending at least $50-100. Dangerous!""As you walk in, handbags are the first thing you see. Last time I visited the store, I was on a mission -- coffee table decor -- but was quickly sidetracked by a large, briefcase-sized, black leather Michael Kors bag priced half-off the suggested retail price. So tempting... but I forgot about this amazing bag when I stumbled upon two quality sweaters thirty seconds later. One was Design History, which is a brand currently sold at Nordstrom, Saks, Neimans, and Bluefly, for only $25. I also found Adrienne Vittadini flats for $29, Meri Meri cupcake kits for $7, Woodwick candles for $10-12, and a luxurious Tahari throw blanket for $29. I walked out of the store minus $120 in my debit account with at least $300+ of product.""I've also been delightfully surprised by the cleanliness of the store and the fitting rooms and by the friendliness of the staff. I was having an issue with my debit card while there, and the two associates that I worked with were very helpful and understanding about the issue.""I'll definitely be going back in the next week or two to see what amazing new deals they'll have then!"""Love the place!!! I could spend all day here and buy up everything!!! I love the HUGE soap selection with decorative box for like 3.99. Jewelry for the bathroom. (I'll post pictures next time). I just spent too much on other things.  Versace handbag retail at $116. For $50 and Tommy Hilfiger rain jacket retail $129 $40!!!. Truly retail therapy!!!! Heavenly experience. Recommend Recommend Recommend!!!No pictures!  I knew I should have taken my camera!"My aunt and I went there today for Mother's day.  I think we must have gotten the lunch menu because everything looked pretty cheap (I've been to the one in Columbus).  My aunt had a chicken dinner (grilled chicken, green beans and potatoes with butter) and I had their Shanghai sampler which had a couple of shrimp, a couple of scallops and a nice piece of salmon, all done perfectly.  We didn't order dessert since my aunt had made my favorite pumpkin pie!  Anyway, dinner was great, and so was the service, thus the five stars!"""A very nice meal in a very nice restaurantPROS:Very good foodinteresting choices--not your typical red lobster crapGreat service"Very clean (restrooms, included)"CONS:"n/a"""This place has great seafood. The best in the area. I come here for seafood every time. Everything on their menu is good. Their menu changes all the time depending on what was in season. Appetizers are amazing like the raw oysters.  Their clam chowder is the best. Really creamy with lots of clams. Wonderful restaurant. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. We love coming to this restaurant. Don't forget a reservation on weekends. You will not get a table and will probably wait an hour or two if you don't have one. We never get to the dessert. Always too full to eat dessert.   Forgot to take pictures."Delightful! After biking on the river trail that led us to the Waterfront, we zoomed past what looked like a wonderful patio situation at Mitchell's, right on the river. We parked our bikes and were seated promptly at the patio. The waitress even filled our water bottles for us! The interior of the restaurant is very nice, sea-themed, and clean. The decor is really tasteful and classy. The outside was perfect. It was Sunday afternoon and the weather was gorgeous. Looking out to a serene part of the river is fabulous as well. Our waiter was professional, knowledgeable and friendly. We decided just on a few drinks and an app. The two drinks my bf ordered were AMAZING. The first, muddled basil, grapefruit juice and vodka (I forget the name). SO refreshing! the basil was flavorful and tasted awesome with the grapefruit juice. The second he got was a frothy pineapple-vodka with a huge fresh chunk of pineapple inside. Both were winners. I stuck with a fairly priced white wine but got to test his fun drinks :) The app we got was the Hawaiian Seared Ahi Tuna and it was delicious as well. It was a pretty decent size to split, and came with sushi rice, a red onion/cucumber relish, ginger and wasabi. I believe the tuna was also drizzled with ponzu. It was so good - definitely recommend! My bf couldn't help himself so he also ordered a cup of lobster bisque, which I don't eat, but he said it was very good. He also polished off some of the warm bread loaf that accompanied our meal. This place definitely earns the stars and I had no idea it was even a chain. The waiter said they were expanding, so hopefully the quality and service don't go down. I also checked out the rest of the menu and they use quality ingredients and the prices really aren't bad (it was the lunch menu - I'm sure the dinner menu is pricier.) I felt like I was on vacation and I'll definitely be back!""We went here for Valentines Day after some traffic downtown made us miss our reservation somewhere else. We both loved it. The calamari is outstanding and if you get there before 7, they run happy hour which is half off apps and $3 beers. ""I had filet and crab cake and it was delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly and the crabcake was a good size. Atmosphere was good and busy but that is likely because of it being Valentines day. Despite the busyness, the wait staff was very attentive.""My wife's steak came out rare despite asking for medium but they took it back and recooked it to a perfect medium level. We will def be back.""""The service is great and friendly. I got the baked spinach and artichoke dip and it was superb. I love the fresh, right out of the oven bread too. I got the Atlantic salmon, and it was probably the best fish I have ever tried. Listened to other yelpers suggestion of the shang hai preparation, and they were right. Just make sure you make a reservation! Best seafood restaurant in da burgh!"absolutely delicious. wonderful service.Beautiful decor. Very genuine staff. Very clean washrooms. Delicious food. I tried the market trio. The blackened tilapia was nice with a little bit of spice. This is a great place for a seafood lover.My husband and I went to Mitchell's last summer for our wedding anniversary. We both took a half day at work and we arrived in the early afternoon (after lunch but before the dinner crowd). I can't say enough about this place...we have gone here on a few occasions and I've always been please with everything. "Pros: Nice friendly waitress, who took some time to take our picture (since it was our anniversary), food was excellent and not extremely overpriced, restaurant and bathrooms were clean!""Cons: None on this visit or any previous visits"""First I would like to say that I was hesitant coming to another fish place recommended by some temporary coworkers since the last place they sent me to made terribly ill. "That being said, I came here and was delighted by my server Michael who was not only friendly but incredibly attentive and very sharp. ""I originally ordered the Mahi Mahi but alas, the ran out upon my ordering, in which case the manager promptly came to ask me for another upgraded selection at no additional charge. Hence, the tuna. ""Now the tuna was amazing. Seared almost perfectly, with the rare flavor still intact. ""I would most definitely come back again and if I lived in the area, this would be one of my top spots.""""Went for dinner Friday evening with friends and sat at the outdoor patio. It is so nice and relaxing there with the river and bike trail. The sourdough bread they serve is always hot and fresh. The Chilean sea bass just melts in your mouth, it was awesome. The Cod stuffed with shrimp and lobster was also very good. I had the carrot cake for dessert, it is big enough for 3 people. It was so delicious. My friend had the creme  brÃ»lÃ©e, which she said was very good. I was here 3 times this summer and every meal was excellent.""My family and I go here whenever there is a special occasion and for good reason. The food is fantastic and the service cannot be beat, at least not when it's coming from the Governor or Kennedy. Best servers in the 'burgh!! I took my Dad there last weekend for his 70th birthday, didn't tell anyone that it was a special night out, but they treated us with such attention, accommodating our needs to a T. Kennedy adjusted meals to fit our taste, suggested things based on what we were looking for, took at least 10 minutes with us going over the menu...I could go on, but needless to say, it was just a fabulous meal and was worth every penny. We got the king crab and bacon wrapped shrimp to start, lobster bisque soup, cedar plank salmon, Chilean sea bass, and a fish medley made to order. We also always get the 7 layer carrot cake, which to me is the best cake anywhere in town.  A must go for anyone looking for an amazing meal and excellent service. But be sure and ask for Kennedy, he's a real dude."Have been here a few times. The wait staff is always top notch and food is very good. I had the steak and lobster tail. Steak was a perfect medium rare and the lobster was also cooked well. Oysters as an app. they appeared fresh and tasted how they should. Overall like in the past we had a great experience at mitchells which is not something I always expect from a chain.Excellent fresh seafood. Good vegetables. Good service. Best place to eat on Waterfront."One of our favorite special occasion restaurants. Five stars for atmosphere. We enjoy the patio and the dining room. The food is superb and the service is also very good. Birthday and anniversary desserts on the house but no hassles like singing or incessant questions about the reason for your visit. One pointer/ don't go on Valentines without a reservation, but the same is true everywhere."They we're so accommodating for my daughter that doesn't like seafood. The food and service was very good."I love old navy clothing, it's vintage styling with good prices. Great jeans too, I love the painter's jeans."This store is laid out better than any other Old Navy I've been to before.  It was so easy to quickly find everything we were looking for.  The staff was also very friendly."If only all Old Navy stores were like this one...""""This is the best bike store I've walked into.  Their primary focus is on racing bikes, but (as I'm not a racer) the service stays top notch in much lower price ranges.""Got greeted by the staff, and my girlfriend and I got the luxury of absolutely no pressure as we walked around and looked at bikes.  She explained what she was looking for, and the staff explained what they had and what price range she was looking at.  I wound up talking to another person working there, and let them try to find a bike that fit.  (I'm 6'8"""", and as I found out, fit pretty well on an XXL Scott 65cm frame.)""Anyways, back to my girlfriend's experience.  What impressed me was after they had a bike they thought was a winner, they let her go on a test ride around the neighborhood there.  And then when she came back in two minutes, told her that wasn't ideal, and sent her back out, with instructions to take the second left and try it on a hill.  After she figured out yes, that was the bike, the guy spent at least half an hour fitting the bike to her; he wound up switching out the stem, adding a seat with a little more travel, and getting everything just so.  There was no hurry.  There was no pressure.""The amount of interest that the staff showed in getting each person the just-so fit gets five stars; if you want a bike that fits, it's worth it to browse here.""And, update: I went out the other day, and asked for a price on a bike costing about 25% of the bike I tooled around on there two weeks ago.  Without batting an eye, and without a hint of bike snobbery, the owner ran off to figure out what it'd cost me.  I talked to him about the differences between a double and triple, and he spent twenty minutes explaining the pros and cons, and gave a strong suggestion on the double.  ""That said, the price he quoted me was also 10% under the price quoted by another shop on the same exact bike.  I asked for the price of an upgrade to a single part on the new bike, and he quoted me about half the price I expected from doing research on the internet.  ""Customer-friendly, well priced, super-high-quality bicycles.  A+++.""Edit, 4 years later: ""Glen, Beth, and the rest of the crew here are still there, and still awesome.  My girlfriend is now my wife.  My lowend Trek road bike now has more miles on it.  :-)""It's still a much longer drive to get to Big Bang, but for any work on my bike, I'm glad to make the drive.  Friends have terrific luck with Pittsburgh Pro, which is nearer,  and I'll occasionally stop there on a ride; that said, for drop-off-the-bike work, Big Bang is my absolute go-to.""""This is the best experience I've had at a bike store in the Pittsburgh area.  I have been shopping around for a couple months for a new road bike (which was going to be my first road bike ever, meaning that I'm fairly clueless about how to pick one out).  Also, since I'm a student, I don't have particularly deep pockets.""At Big Bang, I was greeted basically the moment I walked in the door.  I'm kind of shy when I know that I don't really know what I'm doing, but I wasn't pressured or harassed in any way by the staff.  Even though my price range was pretty low, they still tried their hardest to find a bike that suited my needs, and they found a bike that fitted me perfectly (and gave me an *excellent* deal on the price).  They take a lot of care to make sure you're properly fitted to the bike.""Also, this is one of the few bike stores I've been to where test riding is gleefully encouraged, rather than grudgingly allowed.  Definitely it's the only bike store where they'll tell you """"You haven't tried it out enough, go climb up the hill on  it!"""" -- they definitely put the emphasis on matching rider with bike, rather than making a quick sale.""I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a road bike, whether they're a seasoned racer or a neophyte rider like me."""I wrote this review right after I had bought my bike.  I would like to update to reflect further experiences I've had with BBB."So, first of all, one of the shifters on my bike turned out to be defective (not super-unusual for the Shimano short-reach shifters, also totally not the shop's fault -- these things happen).  Since it was covered under warranty, BBB switched it out for a new set of shifters, at no cost to me.  I had my bike back in a couple days, no muss no fuss.""My husband got a used road bike from Craigslist, and we brought it in for a tuneup.  The bike had several things wrong with it, due to a shoddy assembly job, and BBB basically took the entire bike apart and rebuilt it, cleaning it and replacing various worn-out bits.  I can't remember the total cost of this, but it was under $100.""I would totally recommend BBB, due to their general awesomeness.  I haven't had any of the tuneup-related woes that other people have had with this shop, even when bringing in a bike that I haven't bought there.""""I created an account just to review this shop, it's that awesome.""This is by far the premier shop in all of western PA, and arguably the state. ""Glenn the shop owner is one of the most knowledgeable men in the U.S. when it comes to cycling.  Having spent time in Europe, and with some of the biggest names in the industry, he truly knows what he's talking about.""Furthermore; he's a pleasure to talk to, incredibly friendly and passionate as anything about the sport.  As for bike fitting, this is the only shop I would go to, Glenn's knowledge and background can't be competed with, and he is incredibly thorough.""Yes, they equipment is expensive, but that's a result of the quality they carry..not them setting prices high. Cycling is expensive, end of story. ""If you're looking to pick up your next huffy, go to walmart. If you want a quality bike that is going to fit you, and operate perfectly: go to big bang."""When you walk out of Big Bang Bikes you know you are buying a bike that fits YOU!  Glenn is amazing and he will help you reach your specific goals!  He has amazing passion and knowledge to make you more efficient and comfortable.  The best bike shop...by far.  Great prices and service.  We live in the north and won't hesitate to make the extra drive for anything bike related.This place is the absolute BEST to purchase a bike! I have been searching for a bike for a while now and every place I have gone to have not been NEAR has helpful as Glenn. "The one guy in the shop helped pick me a bike for what I needed and Glenn fit me perfectly to the bike. They also helped me with the bike rack on my car and changed my bike saddle for me! Ohhhh and they gave me the best price on the bike and accessories!!!  Wonderful service. Absolutely will go back! ... Can't wait!""""I've got to be honest, I don't think I've ever been as blown away by customer service as I was here. I went in about half an hour before closing, was not rushed at all. I basically just walked in and said I was interested in a road bike but knew very little about them (I'm a MTBr). I was helped by Glenn, who, within two minutes, had me sitting on a bike, measuring me and adjusting things, and explaining the physics behind positioning and angles and the difference between the male and female physique on a road bike. At no point did he try to upsell anything (in fact, he didn't even ask me about a budget). He just gave me a few things to think about before I invest in something new. He was very obviously focused on getting me the product that will give me the most efficiency and power for my needs. So very impressed...this is absolutely where I will be buying my bike.""If you're in the market for a high quality bike, whether it be road, mountain, racing, or hybrid, go to see Glenn at BBB.  It's very clear that he loves his shop and his job.  I explained my needs and preferences to him and he quickly fitted me with a bike that suited my needs.   I actually bought my Trek 7300 over 3 years ago and I absolutely love it!  He sells only the highest quality bikes and equipment.  Highly recommended.""Big Bang Bicycles is phenomenal! Amazing selection and service! I live in the San Francisco, Bay Area with plenty of premium bicycle shops available, but I do most of my cycling shopping at Big Bang Bicycles when I visit family in Pittsburgh. This shop carries top gear and has in stock tons of options so you can see, feel and evaluate them first hand to know what's going to give you the best feel and performance. Glenn, the owner, is very knowledgeable, friendly and you can feel his passion for cycling and making sure you get the right product and fit for you.  Even if you're not in the Pittsburgh area but you know what you want -- send your order to Big Bang Bicycles and I'm certain you'll have a great experience. Awesome shop! Thank you Glenn and team!""My experience at Big Bang Bicycles was what I have been looking for in the western Pa. area. I have been looking for trusted advice concerning a new road bike and proper fitting during the purchase process.  I am 6'4"" and I found out quickly that regardless of the time of the year, it was very difficult to find a shop which stocked bikes of quality that I could properly test ride.  Big Bang and owner Glenn couldn't have been more patient of all my questions and concerns.  His knowledge is remarkable and he took his time fitting me and explaining the process. He had several bikes I could demo in my size.  After deciding on a model to order Glenn, Craig, and Samson who I had the pleasure of working with, continued to help me through ordering the bike, getting it assembled upon delivery, and taking a significant amount of time going through the bike with me and how to maintain it properly. The shop has an amazing variety of helmets, clothing, and other things that a cyclists might want to purchase. Even though I live in the north hills, if I need anything from service to merchandise, I will not hesitate to go to Big Bang Bicycles.  Glenn and the others that work at the shop are well worth the trip."I am a novice rider looking to customize my bike and very intimidated to walk into the shop. Glen and the staff answered all of my questions and made it so easy to make my riding experience more comfortable. I would recommend this shop to bicyclist of any experience level!"I've lived in 3 cities before coming to Pittsburgh, and I have not received service anywhere better than this place. Their prices and selection are unparalleled elsewhere in the city. The mechanics are certainly the best. and the beuty about this place is they treat everybody with utmost respect - I was treated like I was a pro day 1, even though I am novice in every sense of the word""My only gripe initially was the location, but after coming here several times, I understand why this is the Mecca of bicycles not only in Pittsburgh, but whole Western PA. ""Keep up the good work guys""""This place is a gem. Always helpful, high quality, and great workmanship. This is a great bike shop for any level of rider.""I've ridden, trained on and/or raced bicycles for 30 years and during that time, I've purchased bikes and/or parts from no less than 20 different shops and websites. So it is with a great deal of experience that I can say, with confidence, that this is the best shop I've ever stepped foot (or cleat) in. ""I purchased a new bike and had 3 other bikes serviced there in a short period of time. Glenn, Craig and the ENTIRE team effectively demonstrated technical expertise, a passion for the sport and most importantly, a deep respect for their customers. I not only witnessed it myself but witnessed it with other customers while I was waiting. ""Whether you're new to the sport or a long time cyclist seeking a new and better experience, there simply is no better shop than Big Bang. Their selection, access and overall service is simply unreal. Enjoy this place, it's a treat.""""What, you haven't been to Bellisario's yet? This is about the only red sauce pizza I ever get a craving for, and boy howdy is it good. The crust is on the thin side and ever so crisp on the bottom, while still having enough dough on the edge to provide a nice chewy bit at the end of your slice. The dough itself is flavorful, not too... well, doughy. The sauce is great, and they don't drown the pizza in it. There's just enough cheese; not so much it's an overwhelming grease slick and not so little you can't tell it's there. If you can go while Mama's working, all the better."You can eat in here; they have four or five booths and generations worth of family photos on the walls. Two of us split a small (8-cut) pizza with one topping ($9) and with our two cans of pop we were out for $10. You can't beat that. And I'd put Bellisario's pizza up against any in the city."I grew up a five minute walk away. My mom loved Bellisario's and I have a lot of fond memories of walking through the alley to pick up a cheese pizza to bring home, my mom being too dollar-conscious to pay for delivery when there were perfectly able-bodied children around to go pick it up. Every time I have a slice, it brings back great memories. But I've had outside confirmation that it really is as awesome as I think it is.""It's a little divey, stuck in the back of an old shopping plaza, but it's perfect. If you're in West Mifflin (say, going to Kennywood), drive over and eat a pizza. They've also got hoagies and calzones, and I think that's about it. But with pizza this good, who cares?"""I have been looking for 3 years for good crab rangoon - I finally found it!!!  We had boneless ribs that were absolutely wonderful.  Definitely going back!!!"Ok this is my first yelp review, I never left any reviews for other restaurants, but I am writing it because I want others to know about this place more.""Restaurant run by family. very friendly, clean cooking environment, and Great food. I would come to this place again and again whenever I visit Pittsburgh.""Its less than 10min drive from Kennywood, if you are visiting Kennywood you should definitely try this place.""""Let's look past the fact that it's not an ambient, authentic Chinese atmosphere, let's look at the value, and the flavor, and the fact that there's not much if any competition in the area...""Value is great, they offer several free items if you purchase certain dollar amounts of food. And you get a lot of food for the price you pay!""The flavor was great! I had General Tso's, my wife had Chicken Fried Rice, and my son had Sweet & Sour chicken... no complaints, we all enjoyed it, and even had leftovers!""You can eat there... but it's what I call 'Quick Service' or 'Counter Style', order at the counter, and you sit down. No one will be waiting on you... refilling your ice water every five minutes. This isn't a deal breaker. Besides, you get your food in about 10-15 minutes and it's hot, and delicious!""Competition... there honestly isn't any. The next closest place by comparison is either China Buffet in Century Square, or P.F. Changs. And I don't want buffet, and I don't want to pay an arm and a leg for some simple Chinese food. Further out it's either Silk Road, Sesame Inn, or China Town Inn... and it will take you forever to get to those places than you care to endure.""Hunan Wok - 5 Stars""""Great food, service and prices. It's in a not so great part of town, but lock your doors and it's definitely worth it. Best baked goods in the area! Try the almond torte!!""Thanks to Darren's sis Jessica, we had some excellent cookies for our housewarming party. I liked ths sugar cookies with the jimmies best and the half-dipped chocolate chips, but they were all good. It's too bad about the area in which it is though.""Came here from PGH for the first time.  This bakery is legit.  I bought some Rye bread and Italian 5 grain.  Delicious.  A strange snickerdoodle thing with pink frosting.  Delicious. Chocolate chip cookie dipped in chocolate, extra chewy and humongous.  Delicious."And a sweet old lady serving em up.The best."Delicious."""Absolutely the best bakery I've been in ever! The cookies are delicious. The nut rolls. & coffee cakes are heaven. Put on your bucket list to eat an almond torte. It is extremely memorable. I will dream about Minerva's delicacies until I return to visit the Burgh again. Btw - the staff is the best."The cake was delicious! This bakery is one of oldest and best bakeries in the area. Service was great and prices were even better. Freshly made, just ready to be eaten!:)"Excellent service and excellent baked goods! The staff is so nice! Love everything there including their fabulous sandwich rolls!  I wish they would make a website and also update their facebook page so more people can find out about them!Minerva has awesome cakes! They are cash only. Stop and pick up a delicious cake! I have been enjoying this bakery my entire life!This place is SUCH a GEM!!!! You can taste the love in every item that they make. "3 generations of my family have gotten our wedding cakes from here, and I really hope they're around for my future children to order from. ""Their icing is next level and perfect. Their donuts are perfect. Everything is perfect pretty much. You won't be disappointed.""""We got our wedding cake here back in 2008, and it was AMAZING. The woman that worked with us on design, size, flavor, etc. was extremely helpful and patient. The cake came out beautifully, and was delicious! Since then, nothing I've tasted holds a candle to Minerva's.""You have never had a pierogie until you've driven out to McKees Rocks and picked up a dozen or so from Pierogies Plus. Made primarily by Polish and Ukranian immigrants, these are probably the most authentic/delicious pierogies you can buy in the states. ""If the only pierogies you've ever had were the frozen Mrs. T's you got at Giant Eagle, do yourself a favor and check Pierogies Plus out.""""In Pittsburgh, there IS no other place to get pierogies. Everything is made by hand, fresh every day. And the mix of languages while you wait is a real treat! There are over 30 kinds of pierogies and now that they have expanded, there are a variety of salads and some desserts available too. Don't forget about the haluski and stuffed cabbage! They've been on the Food Network with Bobby Flay, Food Finds, Dave & Dave from WQED, and in numerous newspaper articles. You won't find anything more authentic or delicious as this place. And they ship too!""Years after the first reviewer came here, the quality is still great and deserving of more than 5 stars.""The people who work here and run this place are super friendly and really know their craft. The main owner took my order once and gave me some tips on how to cook the frozen pierogies at home. They turned out ok, but not as good as getting them fresh from the store. ""It can be a bit of a drive from anywhere that's not McKees Rocks (Google Maps takes you through the hood) but it's worth it.""""These are the best pierogies EVER!  My favorite is the jalapeno pierogie, which is not that spicy, but has excellent flavor.  It is such a treat to get these when I'm back in town!"Love butter? Then get thee to Pierogies Plus."I live in St. Louis, and it seems like the only pierogi I can find are in my grocer's freezer. Oh, but when I go home to Pittsburgh, I can have as much of the chewy, flavorful, buttery goodness as I desire from Pierogies Plus.""The place still looks like an old service station with a tiny building and a roof over an old gas pump island. Inside, though, magical elves... uh... I mean fabulous Polish women... create deliciousness with love -- and butter. Have I mentioned that butter is a part of the deal? Because it totally is. You really should fast for two days before picking up pierogi from here.""Oh, but you'll be happy you did. I'm vegetarian, so I only order meat-free pierogi. I'm in love with the saurkraut and the cheese varieties. When you pick up a hot order, you'll get your pierogi covered in with rich butter and sauteed onions. No, I'm serious -- the pierogi are SWIMMING in butter. It's the best thing ever. Everything is packed inside a styrofoam container and a plastic bag, because butter WILL spill out.""You also can order cold or frozen pierogi if you plan to, say, lug them to the middle of the country to enjoy in a far-off city.""Besides many varieties of pierogi, you also can get things from the deli cases. Last time, I had some apricot blintzes, a latke and some type of apple turnover thingy. I really hope Pierogies Plus has the blintzes when I visit next."Awesome thing: Pierogies Plus usually has coupons in the Entertainment Book. My best friend and I steal all of the coupons from our families so that I can get a steady stream of discounted Polish goodness each time I visit."The only downside is that Pierogies Plus often closes for several days around holidays. I totally understand it -- family time is important! -- but that often coincides with my visits (I head east around the holidays mainly because I get an extra day with the fam without having to take another vacation day). I've learned to plan my trips around the Pierogies Plus schedule, though, because I MUST have yummy goodness. A pierogi-less Allison is a cranky Allison.""""These pierogies are one of my favorite things in the world. They're freakin' amazing. The potato and jalapeno ones are my favorite. And I definitely think it's worth it to drive all the way out to McKees Rocks to get them. I like to get them frozen, and bring them home and smother them in butter.""Little ladies, sitting in the back of a renovated gas station perched precariously at the top of a hill, making pierogies and cooking them to perfection in butter and onions... it almost sounds like a strange Pittsburgher fairy tale, but this is no tale - the finest pierogies I've ever eaten emerge from the back of that gas station, and my Polish girlfriend even confirmed that these are better than some of her family's goods.""While in line I met folks from Rhode Island, Kentucky, and North Carolina, who all had come to McKees Rocks in their rental cars straight from the airport before even going to see their families - that is dedication and commitment to some seriously delicious pierogies. After enjoying a dozen of these filling, savory, perfect pierogies, I think once I move away from here I will be making that same trip to Pierogies Plus myself.""""My coworkers and I left our office in Crafton, headed for Pierogies Plus. The journey there took us past bizarre, abandoned-looking buildings, and roads that suddenly ended in cement blockades. The area is prime for use as the setting of a slasher flick. ""BUT, the weird drive is totally worth it. Pierogies Plus is so legit. ""The setting is reminiscent of Seinfeld's 'Soup Nazi': tiny interior, people standing in line shoulder-to-shoulder, and a lady behind the counter brusquely taking orders. Oh, and make sure you order your 'rogies """"hot"""" if you're planning on eating them soon! Otherwise, you get 'em frozen. (There's a slight up-charge for the hot ones, btw -- electricity ain't free!) ""They were out of the plain potato and the potato and cheese varieties when we were there, so I had the platter with pierogies and kielbasa. I opted for the sauerkraut pierogies, and they were SO good! The interior was filled with sauerkraut mixed with potatoes, as opposed to many other sauerkraut pierogies I've had that were filled with only kraut. I definitely prefer the potato/kraut mix! They were also drowning in butter and onions. Like, serious, serious butter - Paula Deen has nothin' on these ladies' butter usage. The kielbasa was awesome, too! I also sampled their haluski and it was the best I've ever had. Tons o' butter, seasoned with generous amounts of salt 'n' pepper, and there was quite a bit of sautÃ©ed onions in the mix, which added even more flavor. ""A few things to note: They have coupons you can print out on their website, but you must cut them out if you're gonna bring 'em in and use them! You cannot just hand them the whole piece of paper. If you want to order a special variety, they need 2 days advance notice (check their site to see what the 'special' ones are). They do accept credit cards, with a $10 min. Yes, some of the ladies are not the friendliest, but the food is so good, they can be like that, and you'll still come back for more!  And, parking is quite limited there. Pretty sure the building is a converted service station. :)""All in all, these pierogies are some of the best I've ever had, and I will definitely be back very soon!"""Update: Get. The. Italian. Sausage. Pierogies. Holy crap. It will change your freaking life!"As a skeptical out of towner, I was pretty wary after the hotel bellhop suggested this off the beaten path place. However this place far exceeded my expectations. We bought an assorted dozen of pierogies and they were all delicious (my favorites being the jalapeÃ±os pierogi and the bacon/potato pierogi).  A great find and an excellent place for someone out of town to try out pierogies!"Best pierogies in tahn!  "I usually just go with the standard potato and cheese but I've also tried a few of the other pierogies and some of the plus.  These pierogies can't be beat.  Made by hand with love in the traditional old world style, I have yet to find better.""It's amazing to get there at 10:55am, 5 minutes before they open and see the mad rush of people getting pierogies.  By 11am, the line is already out the door.  Always a good sign.  They serve their pierogies hot, cold or frozen.  I always go with the hot because nothing beats pierogies bathing in butter and onions.  And here at Pierogies Plus, they are definitely worth the wait."""Just finished a dinner of pierogies that our Pgh family brought to WV - always look forward to Pierogies Plus - try the apricot for a sweet treet!"Apricot with cream cheese, who would have thought...love this place, love it so much.  Print the 10% off coupon on their website before going in.   Make sure u print it out, they will not accept it other wise.""This place has some amazing homemade pierogies! I had never eaten anything besides the usual Mrs. T.'s potato types and boy, was I missing out! We stopped one night and got a some potato/cheddar and some sauerkraut/potato. You can buy them hot or take them home cold. There is a small table outside to eat, but only standing room to order inside.""They had special order pierogies that sounded amazing, but they suggest a 2 day advance order for those. They said sometimes they will have leftover specialty ones for sale, but it all depends on the day. ""They also have haluski, stuffed cabbage and other things that I am looking forward to trying next time.""""My mother is 80+ years old and now lives in New York but she grew up outside of Pittsburgh.  Her parents were Czech and our annual vacations to visit my grandparents were wonderful - filled with family dinners including stuffed cabbage, peirogies, and haluski.  Now that my mother is older and lives alone making things like stuffed cabbage is difficult for her.  I saw Peirogies Plus featured on the Food Network years ago and decided to send my mom an assortment for her birthday.  When her package arrived she called me immediately and said ""Where did you get this food???"".  This is the real deal - traditional, authentic, ethnic food.  The gift I sent took my mother back to her own mother's kitchen.  It's the comfort food to beat all comfort foods - it also takes me back to my childhood all those summers ago!  I'm ordering again for my mother's birthday.  The only ""problem"" now is that I have to order enough to include my brothers and sisters who mysteriously show up at my mother's house once the rumor that the package has arrived makes the rounds.""This little former gas station makes some incredibly delicious pierogies. Order ahead for big holidays - we order several dozen every year for Easter and the take out line stretches out the door all day on Good Friday. I particularly like the apricot and cream cheese and the prune varieties. Potato and cheddar are great, too, of course!""WARNING: ADDICTING POTATOE VERSION OF CRACK -----CHEAP, frozen, cold or hot.  PARKING SUCKS on busy route 51 mckees rocks only enough room for approx 6-8 cars. SUPER BUSY best time to come is between 1pm-4pm------g8 food.  Outside in good weather there is a couple little tables to sit at., but not during the winter/early spring.  MOST CUSTOMERS ARE TO GO TAKE HOME . hours monday 11-6, tues-friday 11-7 -----   closed sat/sun""Yummy! I've never tried Polish food aside from a sausage. I have to say it was really good. The ladies that worked there were very nice. The only down side it took a while to get my food. I think it's made to order. Regardless, when I received my food it was streaming hot. Let's just say for me it was worth the wait.""Best pierogies I've ever had.  And, seeing as how I'm from Pittsburgh.... that's a lot.  The apricot and cream cheese pierogies are amazing!!!  GO."Great food!  I have been eating at Pierogies Plus since they opened.  Great food all around!  The Halupki and Halushki are awesome as well as the Pierogies."We went way out of our way on a long road trip to stop here, and it was worth it. It's just one of those funky little neighborhood spots that does a great job at its specialty. Ordering was a little awkward but we got through it. We didn't mind sitting in the crappy little outdoor seating area--it was better than getting back in the car.""Good food, great staff.  Always friendly always clean very consistent.   The breakfast sandwich is awesome.""On a random Sunday morning I went in search of a good breakfast spot.  I decided to explore the McKees Rocks neighborhood and came upon Marge's Place.  I hadn't heard much about this place, but after reading the few reviews I could find, I decided to give it a try.  ""Inside, it's bigger than I expected but still has that down home diner feel.  My guess is that most of the people there were regulars.  The wait staff was friendly to those they knew but also welcoming to me, someone they had never seen before.  I picked a table in the corner so I could observe what I imagine was a typical Sunday morning.  I ordered the breakfast special: 2 scrambled eggs with bacon, potatoes and toast.  Any place that has Mancini's Italian toast already gets thumbs up in my book.  Being in McKees Rocks, though, they really don't have a choice.  The potatoes were thin sliced with onions and very flavorful.  The only way I can think of to describe the bacon is...porkier.  Is that even a word?  I just don't know how else to descibe it.  The combination of foods was served in generous portions at a great price (under $5).  ""One random note: I liked the tables and chairs.  They were comfortable not just for sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee with my morning paper but also very comfortable for sitting and eating.  Good distance between the table and chairs.  That may sound silly, and I thought so, too, at first.  But when I go to a place and the booth is too wide or too narrow, it can hinder my enjoyment.  ""Not only will I return, but I will also recommend Marge's Place to anyone in the area.  It was a surprisingly good find.  I like places like neighborhood businesses like this where they make everyone feel like they belong."""Great small town breakfast spot Highly recommend George's Mixed Grill ... Delicious"I have live around this area all my life and My family would go here and I would always decline to go, that is until Saturday my brother asked me if I wanted to go to breakfast and I had to say yes (just posted on facebook that I wanted to go to breakfast and nobody wanted to go with me) Lets get to the review I am glad I said yes there homefries are awesome the eggs were just right. I would definitely go here again."I'm new to Pittsburgh so I wanted to try out all the local spots first and let me tell you... This spot is definitely worth a try! It's a cute diner with a lot of local charm. The prices are awesome and the food is even better! I had the cinnamon raisin french toast with the home fries and a coffee. All of it was really good. I'm not a complainer but I'm picky and honestly...I have nothing but good things to say about this place. I highly recommend you stop by and give it a try! You can thank me later. ;)"Great service, friendly staff, great food, great prices. What more can you ask for in a small town breakfast place? Will definitely be back""Always a favorite. New name (Broadway brunch), but the same great food. Good coffee.quick service, friendly waitstaff. Good home cooked foots at reasonable prices. The neighborhood is a bit sketchy, so lock your car doors. ""  Local foods ( Mancinis toast, Riccis sausage). Atmosphere is loud, smokey and a bit greasy, but the delicious food is worth it. ""You can't beat Marges place for a great deal. 2 eggs cooked to order, the best home fries I know of, crisp hickory bacon, Rocco's sausage, hot buttered Mancinis toast and vanilla French toast...$6.99""I hope it never changes by going upscale or healthy ( organic, vegan etc). "" Parking meters are 10 cents an hour.""""This was our first time visiting Broadway Brunch and we were NOT disappointed! I found them on Yelp and read the reviews and thought we should give it a go. Everything was delicious, and I'm a very picky eater. The coffee was wonderful and my eggs were just right. I can't tell you the last time I ordered eggs over medium and actually GOT eggs over medium. No burned crusty edges or anything! And the bacon, oh the bacon, It was perfect! This place is a gem and I can't wait to bring my mom and sister here next time they visit. The owners RJ and Kelly were super nice and even came to check on us to make sure everything was good. They are also in the process of remodeling to give it more of a 50's feel. If you're looking for a great little homey feeling diner with great food and affordable prices, this is the place!""My dad grew up in McKees Rocks so whenever we are back visiting relatives we stop at Mancini's. This is right down the street and we have never stopped here. What a pleasant surprise for The Rocks. Great breakfast specials, mixed grill was superb and of course they serve Mancini's which makes the best French toast.""Great service, fantastic atmosphere... friendliest owners ever!! The VIKING'S Breakfast though WOW!!!! Highly recommend this place!!""The true test of a great breakfast place is its ability to produce the perfect over medium egg, the whites cooked through and the yokes, unbroken, warm and runny. Many places have either produced broken or rock hard yokes (over hard) or runny whites (over easy) in their attempts to create an over medium egg, but Broadway Brunch completely nailed it! I'm so glad I found this little breakfast treasure trove and look forward to visiting again on my next trip to Pittsburgh."Just moved to the area and decided to have a breakfast date at this small town diner I saw on google maps. It was within walking distance so I figured it was worth a try."Food was absolutely great, coffee was great and our server was extremely sweet and polite. I believe this is going to be a once a week breakfast date spot for me and my girl."""FANTASTIC PLACE! New owners make this place warm and family friendly!"The portion size is worth its weight in gold. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone."""Best Pizza in the western hemisphere!"I may be a little biased here based on the fact that I've been eating at this place since... I was born.  With that said, I've eaten pizza all of the USA and this is still my absolute favorite place to order Pizza from.  When I come home to Pittsburgh for a visit ordering from Pasquarelli's is a MUST!   It is a true mom and pop pizza dive.  The owners are really nice and man can they cook.  The Pizza is unique.  Handmade dough, homemade sauce, tasty cheese, you name it.  I love this place!""If you order here please don't stop at Pizza!  I've never had a meatball that is better than Mrs. P's meatballs.  They are so good that I don't compare other meatballs to them because it isn't fair to the other cooks.  The Steak Hoagie is also one of my favorites.  This place isn't cheap but this is real handmade food!  If you want cheap pizza go to pizza hut."""Best pizza ever!"This pizza spot came HIGHLY recommended by several friends and we finally got a chance to taste the awesomeness! Stuffed crust with sauce that is not too sweet and not too bitter, pepperoni and mushroom was a GREAT combo! Cash only and sooooo worth it!"This is the best pizza in McKee's Rocks. Mom and pop shop.  It's just a little shed located across from the dollar general.  The pizza is amazing!  The old lady answers the phone and takes care of the money.  The old man makes the pizzas.  You don't need extra toppings because they give you plenty of fresh ingredients. A large pizza will feed a family of 4 even 5.  The crust is dusty and crunchy.  The sauce is one of a kind.  It's CASH only so make sure you stop at the bank before you get there.  Oh and they don't deliver either.  Like I said it's a mom and pop shop of two employees only.    In fact I'm ordering a pie tonight.  Ps it's great the next day in the oven.This place is amazing!!! Jim is a great artist!!! Traveled all the way from Tampa just to get my tattoo!!! I would recommend this place to everyone!!!Got my first tattoo here in 1993 and my second a couple weeks later. All these Years later they still look great. Haven't faded much and haven't"Had em touched up. The shop is Professional and clean, I highly ""Recommend. Excellent quality work."""The 7 ounce house sirloin is the bomb! 'Nuff said.Haven't been here in a long time.  Never thought Applebee's would be so good. "The new Sriracha Shrimp are fantastic.  BBQ-ish, spicy,  fried perfectly. "The Pub Philly with extra grilled jalapeÃ±o was another hit."If you get fries, get the BBQ dust on them or on the side. "Best part was their in house made spicy cucumbers.  Pickles gone WILD!"If you sit at the bar, see Nucc. He's great.""""I travel a lot and have eaten at a lot of Hibachi restaurants. I happen to have a project in the Pittsburgh area and was looking for a Hibachi place to take my co-workers. I read several reviews on other Hibachi places and they all sound the same. The typical they are so busy the service sucks and they rush you in and out to turn tables quickly.  I found Sapporo and was very pleased! It is in an odd location but once you step inside, you feel the ambiance of cozy and family style. My party felt the staff was very friendly.""I had ordered the filet and shrimp with fried rice. The others in my group ordered chicken broccoli, and the Sapporo Deluxe which consists of lobster, filet and shrimp. We all got started with the soup and salads, which was a pretty good size. I didn't want to finish it all because I wanted to save room for dinner. Our Chef was one of the most personable Chef's I have encountered. He was very talkative and really wanted to get to know us. My file was delicious and the fried rice was excellent. They make their fried rice from scratch. It's not prepared ahead of time like I see at most Hibachi places. I can definitely tell the difference. My friend Sam who ordered the chicken broccoli could not stop raving about the sauce that they used. It is unlike soy sauce or teriyaki sauce. We asked the Chef about the sauce and sure enough it is one of a kind. Dan, who ordered the Sapporo Deluxe was very pleased with his meal and couldn't even finish it. Actually we all needed to-go boxes. The portion amount here is incredible. You definitely get your money's worth here!!"I would highly recommend this place to Hibachi lovers because this place is surely a secret in Pittsburgh. I can not stress how different this place is compared to other Hibachi places. I think this restaurant is family owned and not a chain which I can always appreciate. Thank you Sapporo for a great Hibachi experience!! I will be back for sure!"Anh""""Sapporo is my favorite Japanese restaurant, period. I've found other places that come close, but for me, this is the place I like to spend my money when it comes to hibachi cuisine. ""Sapporo is an unassuming place right next to Steubenville Pike's hottest tourist attraction, the Pittsburgh Motel. But don't let the location fool you. Step inside and enjoy a cozy atmosphere. There's a bar at the front, some tables to the right, and the main dining area to the left. There's also that karaoke machine I've never seen used in all the years I've gone here.""Unlike other Japanese restaurants like Saga (great stuff) and Ichiban, the cooks at Sapporo aren't all about giving an extensive show while cooking. Each of the chefs have a few of the basic crowd pleasers, such as the knife and spatula toss and the onion volcano, etc., but really it's all about the food, which is fine by me. I do sometimes miss when the chefs toss the pieces of shrimp up in the air towards your mouth to catch, but only because no one ever likes to participate in that but me and it's fun to look like a goofball while trying, but that's neither here nor there.""The food here is excellent. They've introduced a new look to their menu recently. I don't know if they scaled it down, as I often always order from the same section. I did notice they have a couple of sushi options available. They used to have a full sushi bar, and you can still see that when you walk in, but I'm not sure if they're using it for anything other than just what's on the main menu, which would be a shame if so, as their sushi was always great and you could order it from a separate menu. Again, this may be something they still have that I'm not aware of.""At any rate, the starter soup and salad is great. I love the bits of onion in the soup. It's a very strong broth, but not overpowering. The ginger dressing on the salad is something you either like or loathe at any Japanese restaurant, and here I really love it, but I tend to like it everywhere I've had it, so I'm not a real stickler when it comes to that.""Usually I order the filet mignon and shrimp with fried rice for my main meal, though last time I got the deluxe version of the dish which also includes lobster tail and ice cream for dessert. Either way, it's a great dish. I've also had the chicken and shrimp and have enjoyed it as well.""Now, my favorite thing here is the shrimp sauce. I call it the """"magic sauce."""" It's of the light pink variety and thin consistency. I'm always disappointed when I go to other Japanese steakhouses and they either don't have shrimp sauce altogether or they have the thicker, mayonnaise-based version, which is OK, but doesn't come close to the awesomeness that is the magic sauce. Apparently it's a secret as to just what goes into it. On one visit our chef joked that its main base was strawberry Quik, which one of the fellow diners at my table believed.""So if you get the fried rice here, dump some of the magic sauce on there. It's amazing. Use it for your steak or chicken as well. I find myself doing that and then saving the darker sauce for my grilled veggies, which are also top notch here. Terrific grilled onions and ripe zucchini as well as mushrooms and broccoli. I don't care for broccoli personally, but the rest is excellent.""Sapporo has also started throwing in noodles to the mix. According to the owner this is because other restaurants started doing it, so patrons who came in started asking why Sapporo didn't have them as well. I think they were doing fine without them, as it just adds even more to an already large amount of food, but they are good, if unnecessary.""The steak here is great. I've had the sirloin as well as the filet. I always get mine cooked rare, and it is of the melt in your mouth caliber. The shrimp never taste fishy, and the lobster tail is similarly excellent. All around, you get a great meal here for the price.""I'm not sure which nights are more crowded than not anymore. Sapporo's a funny place in that some weeknights you'll drive by and it's packed and then other nights it will be quiet. I'd suppose weekends draw the biggest crowds. Yet even when it was """"packed"""" I've never had to wait long to be seated at a table.""So if you haven't been, give Sapporo a try. It's been there forever. The owner and staff are super nice and they really do care about serving you great food when you visit. They don't do lunches anymore, so it's strictly dinner meals, so be looking at spending at least 20-30 dollars on up for adults, and around 10 or so for kids' meals. It's not some place you would go frequently if you're on a budget, but that makes it all the more a treat when you do go.""""Been to many hibachis, this one is very clean, the building is a little older but the family that runs it does a wonderful job. ""I came here and got the chicken. Spot on, I loved the beef stew it came with- I always think the salad at hibachis are real alright- but the sushi was delicious and the hibachi was wonderful with delicious noodles , veggies, and rice- best I have had in a while because it ain't too salty- many times for me it's too extreme on the salt."Free edamame with check in so that was a plus. Reasonably priced delicious Japanese goodness- seemed like it also had good drinks."Will return.""""My boyfriend and I are practically Hibachi connoisseurs so when we visited Pittsburgh for the weekend the first thing we Yelp searched was.. you guessed it, Hibachi! Sapporo was highly rated so we went for dinner on a Saturday night."The restaurant is located in front of a dimly lit motel but don't be discouraged by the facade because once you step inside the door the atmosphere is warm and inviting. "We were greeted by the owner's daughter who sat us at an empty table while we waited for the other guests to join us. The owner's son brought us menus to look over and informed us that Sapporo is a family-run establishment. The table quickly filled with regulars who said that Sapporo was their favorite Hibachi restaurant in Pittsburgh, one couple even said that they come for dinner every single Saturday evening. The owner himself came over to our table and began cooking our meal!""I ordered the Hibachi chicken and broccoli in Sapporo special sauce and my boyfriend ordered the Hibachi shrimp and chicken, both with fried rice. Both meals were good but the special sauce on my chicken was absolutely delicious! Definitely one of the best Hibachi chicken variation that I have tasted and my boyfriend really enjoyed how flavorful his shrimp tasted. The chef, a Korean war veteran, was engaging in our conversation and made you feel as if you were over a friend's house for dinner.""We both agreed that we will definitely return to Sapporo the next time that we are in Pittsburgh.""""Best Italian Sausage in the Burgh!  Great to use for sandwiches, spaghetti or grilling.  They also have sandwiches (sausage, meatballs) to eat in or take out.  Stuffed Banana Peppers are out of the world.  Sausage is not greasy with natural casings.  You may have seen Ernie Ricci on Cooking with Chris Fennimore on Qed.  Many restaurants in Pittsburgh use Ricci's sausage.  Some days you can watch them make the sausage thru a window."I would have taken a picture of my meal but I devoured it too quickly.DJ J.   Is correct.    I heard about this place on PBS (What do Pittsburgher's Eat).   They were giving their recipe for the Sausage Onions and Peppers.    We decided to try.They only have tables where you can stand and eat.   They make everything on the premises.   We ate in.   I ordered the Hot Italian Sausage Sandwich and some side meatballs.    The food was awesome!."I recommend you find this gem and get your Italian Fix on (or order some of their meats / products and cook it yourself) :)"""I was looking for a florist to deliver flowers for me as I live in Texas and Cindy Esser's had the best floral website I have ever seen.  It was so easy to work with and order.  "I also, just recently, went into their store and the staff was fantastic.  These guys know their stuff and do great work."""Cyril did my sister's wedding and now is working on things for my brother's wedding.  He is wonderful to work with.  Helpful in every way.  My sister's flowers were stunning."My fiancÃ©e and I have made R&B's our Friday night dinner tradition for over a year. the food is consistently amazing, and portions are HUGE. Whether you choose to pick up or have it delivered, it's always less then 30 minutes - and can we take a second to acknowledge the staff? Always exceedingly friendly, and happy to accommodate any special requests. Sadly, we're moving out of the area in two weeks, so we won't be able to continue our tradition. But if you haven't given them a try, do it! (might I suggest the Buffalo Chicken sub and the cheese and bacon fries? epic!)"Get the white pizza with bacon. You're life will never be the same. Never had a bad experience ordering from R&B's."My boyfriend and I ordered the R&B's Special Pie (no bacon) last night and the greek salad (added artichokes).  So good!  The pizza was one of the best I have had in a long time, and I eat a lot of pizza! The salad was huge and fed us both easily.  It certainly wasn't as cheap as Dominos, but the quality was great and so delicious.  I would give R&Bs at least $$ when it comes to price, but if you are willing to pay the extra money for good quality, then I highly recommend this pizza joint.""They took me right in and I didn't have to wait. They were extremely fast and courteous. Some people complain about they trying to upsell services, and normally I hate when places do that, but I never felt pushed. There were two things that he recommended I do within in the next six months, and I already knew about them. I've seriously waited longer in some fast food drive thrus!""Great service, in and out in a timely manor.  No pressure at all to purchase any additional unwanted services.  Will be back!!"Luigi's pizza is amazing! The sicilian pizza takes me back to how my grandma used to make homemade pizza. I can't wait to go back - definitely worth the 45-minute trip there :)"Luigis is the best of the best. Awesome, authentic pepperoni. I have eaten here for years. This place is a tradition in my family and it's still as good as they were 15 years ago. They recently remodeled and have a great menu selection. By far the best pizza in Bellevue and right up there with Fioris as the best in Pittsburgh.""My wife and I LOVE this place. Decently affordable, our server is always great and very friendly, the food is delicious and it's a nice home-y atmosphere. The first time we went here, we told the server we were newlyweds and Luigi made us tiramisu and gave it to us for free! Highly recommend."This place has great tasting food. I had a italian hoagie and it was great. The pizza is top notch."I was one of their first customers starting at the old location. I live further away now, but will stop anytime I am near as they quite simply have the BEST PIZZA period of anywhere I've been. I have referred many friends and family and they all say the same. The owners and staff are very friendly and caring people and treat you like family. The other food is good too, especially the wedding soup, although 95% of the time we get the great pizza. The dough, sauce and cheese are second to none."I am SHOCKED to see this place isn't five stars. "We order delivery from here at least once a week. Their lunch specials are GREAT, and the portions are always, always plentiful. I've never waited more than 25 minutes, even though they always say 45. I think it's respectful just in case they run behind. ""I will say that if you are looking for a truly authentic Chinese meal, this probably isn't your best option (although WAY more authentic than House of Lee. YUCK!) Both my boyfriend and I think it is plenty authentic for us, always delicious. I have cravings for their eggrolls daily, he loves their wonton soup. It is the only kind of soup I will eat, it's that good. ""And we love the cute, little Chinese guy that usually delivers our food. My bf and I always get the biggest smiles on our faces when we hear our apt buzz with """" CHINA SEEAAA!!"""" =)"""Fair prices but good quality... And amazing designs that are custom made.... Plus gel and solar nails are available for those interested... Offers waxing services... Completely renovated and the spa pedicure chair is amazing..."For over 20 years the Avalon Veterinary Hospital staff has treated my pets: cats, rabbits, fish, and a turtle.  The prices are very reasonable, and I've never been charged for follow-ups.""Dr. Fitzgerald provided an affordable diabetes treatment plan for my cat to prolong his life; the prognosis went from a few months to three healthy years.  When my cat suddenly had kidney failure from diabetic shock, I was only charged for the treatment--not the emergency appointment fees. The staff was extremely considerate when my cat passed--some who knew him were even crying."My other cat gained a reputation as a menace.  But the staff never complained--not even when she required four people to hold her down just to get her shots."When I was sold a diseased turtle a a child, Dr. Moore was very kind and did not charge for the visit nor the medication.  He recognized my interest in science and patiently answered all of my 11-year-old questions.  He even showed me how he made slides and how his microscope worked. (I later studied biology and worked as a lab tech, so thanks.)  Dr. Moore also took exemplary care of our rabbits, who all lived unusually long lives.""On a practical note, they require ALL animals to be in a cage or on a leash.  I once had a well-behaved cat, who was too sick to chase the dogs, wrapped in a blanket since his collar would have been over an open wound...But they generally enforce the cage/leash policy for the safety of all animals.  There is a small parking lot next to the clinic or you can usually park pretty easily on the cross-street.""""Excellent!!  Dr. Fitzgerald and Dr. Bigger are SUPERIOR in their knowledge and manner. Reasonable prices, very friendly, caring staff. I wouldn't go anywhere else!""If I could give Dr. Bigger 10 stars I would! He makes that hospital. If this review was on Dr. Moore I would give it a minus 10....he is terribly rude. I am moving back to Sewickley and will plan to use Dr. Bigger for sure. He is the best vet I have ever experienced...so detailed, so caring..I just love him and so do my animals..."My puppy was admitted here 6 days ago. In very poor shape. I was scared he wasn't going to make it. And being it was my 4 yr Olds new dog made things a bit harder on us.

Special thanks to Dr v and Lenny !"The only vet I will use from now on! The staff is amazing! From the receptionist to the vet. It really does take a team to provide great service. I was bringing my cat in as a new patient with concerns about his back leg. They fit me in the next day! I called them at 4:30 pm on Monday and they had me in Tuesday at 5:30! This alone was amazing on account that the vet I use to take him to never returned my calls. The vet (Kouch I maybe spelling that wrong) was so patient with my not so happy cat. She diagnosed the issue. It was his poor back. They filled a prescription, updated his shots, and didn't run any test that weren't necessary. I want to trust the vet to provide the care that my animal needs, not run me through the ringer. I will do anything for my cat. For them to be honest about what is necessary and what's not put my mind at ease that he was getting the treatment he needed and no unnecessary test that would only stress him out.  Great job! Hopefully we will be back for just shots but if anything else does come up you will be seeing me and tyty again.""This is my favorite 'event' restaurant (by which I mean, spendy, but definitely worth it for special occasions).  It is great for intimate birthdays, celebrations, etc.  Whatever karmic intervention gave the 'Bustling Borough of Bellevue' this restaurant makes me think we, as a community, has done something right. ""But more importantly the food...  Oh, the food!  The owner/chef takes so much care, it makes the whole experience very enjoyable.  I have never had a bad meal.  ""I""""My boyfriend and i went here last night. the restaurant is dark romantic and the decor is amazing. There are photographs of the owners and chefs family on the walls.... its cute. My boyfriend called ahead and told them i was vegetarian and the chef prepared a couple of things for me.  There is no set menu and the waitress reads out what the chef has prepared for the night there are 5 courses. an appetizer, pasta, main course, a salad and and dessert. I thought the salad after the entree was pretty interesting . They are also very generous with the bread which i LOVED!!!!"Every meal was made to perfection. It had a homey feeling .....My boyfriend had some scallops that he is still talking about.  My entree was spaghetti squash with mushroom wild rice and berries and limed artichokes. There were soo many flavors and all the ingredients were balanced. The service was great. All in all it was an amazing experience. The chef came out to say hi at the end of the night...... i finished off my dinner with the creme brulee and some coffee. Our bill came to $120 with tip and it was absolutely worth it .This is a great restaurant for a super special occasions and  it is very private.Not to dressy and not too casual. Pick out a great bottle of wine or two and get ready to get your taste buds blown." Im pretty sure my boyfriend and i will be going back."""Yes!!!!!!Great service!Great Food!"Love the BYOB!!! ($5).""""I went to VIVO on a whim while searching for a good BYOB to celebrate a special occasion with my other half.  I was skeptical as I had never been to Bellvue before and knew there was not much there.  I was pleasantly surprised with VIVO's atmosphere.  In the heart of this small neighborhood, I found a fabulous, european like restaurant that tickled my taste pallette.  The menu is entirely verbal and progressive meaning your entree order is not taken until you are finished with your appetizer.  Something I had come to know and love when studying abroad in Italy.  After a lengthy meal of beyond exceptional food, the Chef/Owner visited our table (and everyone elses) to ensure satisfaction and talk to us about our lives and the life of VIVO!  He was sincere, personable and a real treat to the already amazing food!  This place is worth every penny!!! Viva la VIVO!!!""My sister lives in Bellevue, and I have used Fred Dietz Floral twice now to send her flowers (I live out of state).  The woman who answers the phone is amazing- she is kind, helpful, and professional.  Being remote can make this process difficult, but she is very descriptive, and willing to make your desires work in your price range.  My sister says the arrangements have been lovely and lasting.  I highly recommend patronizing this business.""Suzanne and Kristi are both excellent! Beautiful job on cuts and color. My whole family goes to them now, even the guys! They are always pleased with results and I get lots of compliments.""Let me just tell you, I have really, really difficult hair.  type 3b Naturally curly, 100% grey, I dye it dark and mess with the color myself. ( never good)  If you want to know where to get a good haircut you ask someone with my hair. Since I have been going to Mane Attractions I have really LOVED my hair. I have been going there for about 4 years. Kristi was even able to cut my curly hair into a short reverse bob without making me look like i was wearing a helmet. ( you curly girls know what I am talking about). I have had nothing but complements on my hair and even my mom( who is always honest) is impressed. The only complaint I ever have is that yes, sometimes I have gone there on the spur of the moment and it has been closed during the week. I just know to call and schedule things. it is a small business and I get it.  P.S. kids haircuts are only 10$ and My daughter loves it.""Krispy Creme? Grocery store cakes?  Git ahta tahn.... when it comes to donuts, pastries, and cakes they don't hold a wisk to Lincoln Bakery in Bellevue (or most Western PA bakeries for that matter).  Their cakes hit the top of my list (with Edy's downtown coming in second).  The batter is light and moist while the icing is smooth -- not too sweet - not too 'lardy'.  By all means, feel free to give them a decorating challenge as their peeps got mad skillz.""In my experience, Pittsburgh natives don't seem to realize how good their sweet tooths have it here, till they move away.  So, when I travel westward for the holidays I bring some Lincoln Bakery sweets along."I highly recommend their Burnt Almond Torte with either custard or lemon filling for nearly any occasion.  I get these for corporate gatherings often and they always go over well - and you know what they say about trying to please everyone!I'd suggest giving them a few days to a weeks notice as they keep pretty busy."(As a side note: though I rave about their donuts, pastries, and cakes.... for cookies I'd recommend Moi's Italian Bakery in Monroeville).""""The Lincoln Bakery did my wedding cake - White cake, chocolate mousse filling, and buttercream icing... it was fabulous! We got so many compliments, not only did it look beautiful but it tasted great!""Quite possibly the best bakery in Pittsburgh.  It's got everything from the low-end (cookies, cupcakes, donuts) to the high (wedding cakes, tortes, tarts).  Make any special or large orders weeks in advance.  The tastiest wedding cake I ever sampled was from here: smooth buttercream icing with alternating raspberry and lemon filling in white batter.""I love Lincoln Bakery so much.  We just got a birthday cake from here today, and everyone at the party loved it.  I seriously cannot believe how gorgeous it was.  For fall cakes and cupcakes, I can't even imagine anyone making anything prettier!  The icing is wonderful, although the colored icing is sort of bitter (but I think that is the case anywhere).  The white icing is just perfect and not too sweet.  When I told my neighbor that I was coming here tonight to pick up the cake, she immediately asked me if I had ever had the carrot cake.  Yes, I have, and it is amazing!  The burnt almond torte rivals Prantl's.  I think the girls who work there are so nice and helpful.  And I love all of the homemade candy that they sell.  It is just the sweetest local gem.  Love Lincoln Bakery."My daughter CAN'T pass by here without asking to get something.  All I can say is you had better bring your sweet tooth!"I ordered a cake for a baptism. I did a search on the best tasting cake around Pittsburgh and after reading reviews, Lincoln bakery was the one we had to try.""I called them a week ahead, they told me the design they would do and after seeing some pictures on their Facebook page I trusted it will work out so I went ahead and ordered it. "It was a big hit! Some of my family members were getting seconds. "The cake wasn't too sweet and the icing not too """"buttery"""". I will have to say that next time I need a cake I will order from this bakery, and maybe try some of the other things they carry in their store.""""Love,love,love Lincoln Bakery! My absolute favorite is the chocolate pudding cake. It comes with mounds of chocolate shavings on top. They also gave fantastic carrot cake and cheese cakes. Always something delicious in the pastry counter. "The seasonal cakes are always so creative and fun to look at in the window."The staff there is pretty great as well. Especially Dottie. She's been there for years and is always so kind.""""My new favorite stop.  If you like carrot cake this is certainly the place to try  and  you will not be disappointed!  Truthfully, I did not know what to expect during my first visit but everything I have purchased since then  has been fresh and satisfying."Had to make a trip to Leetsdale to visit a client and found myself in an area where I struggled to find a place for goodies.  A quick yelp search revealed Lincoln Bakery."This place is awesome and it is now saved in my GPS for future stops.  Highly recommend."""I've never had anything bad from here! Their buttercream icing is more buttery than it is sugary. It's amazing. Plus they have the coolest Holiday cakes!"I recently purchased my 6th vehicle from Bob and Linda at Metro Motors.  A unique 2006 BMW 530XIT touring wagon. I keep returning for the great deals and quality selection of highline vehicles. If you are a car Guy like me , you will feel like a kid in a candy store! Do yourself a favor and stop in for your next vehicle.  These Folks go above and beyond to ensure a delightful buying experience!"Kuhn's is the perfect grocery store for Bellevue! Staff are friendly and helpful and the store is small enough to navigate in a few minutes which makes it great for picking up weekly groceries. "Always happy with the produce and fresh fruit selections--I even bought kale there last week. Deli is busy after work and for good reason. Fair prices and a big selection of meats, cheeses and side dishes. "Grocery store is open til MIDNIGHT throughout the week (closes earlier on Sundays...9?) so you can run in for those last minute things."There's also a Redbox out front so when your friend has a breakup, swing by for ice cream and a chick flick. Compliments of Kuhn's!""""Without question, this is my favorite thrift store in the greater Pittsburgh region. I find antique kitchenwares here that are older than my grandma, worth $85 if the antique mall is to be believed, and priced at $2.50. The 50%-off sales actually pay off here. The merchandise turns over quickly. The staff is a real cast of characters (don't miss the steelers tattoos!!! i'm seriously serious, they are amazing). there are bicycles for you and your kids in decent-semi-working condition. The balance of stuff is about half and half valuable old vintage and more modern hand-me-downs. The prices are reasonable to cheap. The plastic bags on the wall are often a treasure trove. The kitchen section could outfit your kitchen in fondue pots for days. Most thrift store remodels result in ridiculous high prices to pay for the construction. The remodel here just means a bigger, cleaner store and parking lot. ""I have spent, cumulatively, probably  several weeks of my life in this store. This is, hands-down, without question, the thing I miss most about leaving Pittsburgh. This store is the largest single contributor to my wardrobe, outside of H&M."""Woo Hoo!  Dead Lady."This thrift store rocks.  I have been doing this for more years that I haven't been, and it is the best in the city.""I would make a weekly trek to RWB, and would never be disappointed.  These were the days when you could find a vintage 50s something or other on the racks, before there was a """"Vintage"""" section.  Still, recently, there is always a treasure to be had, especially in the housewares department.  The proximity of this thrift store to the affluent neighborhood of Sewickley accounts for its top-notch merch.  Whenever we'd have a particularly good day, my frends and I would joke...""""dead lady."""""""I came here all the time while I was freelancing and in charge of my own schedule.  It has a lot of points going for it that other thrift shops consistently mess up."1. It's well lit.  You can SEE the clothing, see whatever might be wrong with it, and make an honest assessment.  You're never surprised when you leave at the state of the items you've just bought.""2. It is surprisingly clean.  Nothing seems to smell, so I can only imagine they've laundered everything thoroughly. ""3. There are good quality brands--Ann Taylor, Kenneth Cole, etc.  It's mainly items along these lines.  You're more likely to find twinsets than clubbing tops here, which if you're over the age of 21 is a good thing.""4. Markdowns and fresh merchandise.  These people *know* how to turn over their stock.  Because the place is never empty, and there are specials every day, the stock flips rapidly.  The merchandise is never the same week to week, so as I mentioned before, it's addictive.  You never know what you'll find.""A summary of a few things I've bought here: a 6 dollar designer knit dress, a few silk twinsets ($2-$5), countless heels, two pairs of Birkenstocks and two pairs of Doc Martens ($4-$8), a dressmaker's bust ($5), a pressure cooker ($7)....""You get the picture.  The prices aren't rock bottom, but close enough, and the quality of the clothing will help anyone but the stingiest person get over the 50 cents extra.""Can't recommend it enough!"""My very favorite store in the world!  Their recent remodel made it bigger and easier to find things and not have to get stuck in an aisle with 10 other people."I get 80% of my wardrobe from here - the shoes and purses are the best and have always found something great to take home"""Simply the best thrift store I've ever been to. Well worth the 3 1/2 hour drive from my hometown."First, and foremost, EVERYTHING IS 1/2 off all of the time!""Secondly, bring cash. They DO NOT accept credit cards.""The store is full of wonderful pieces of clothing, all arranged by color and type (not by size, which is unfortunate). I found a wide selection of everything from casual pieces to high-end business attire to super-trendy teen clothing... what surprised me most about this store was the QUALITY of the clothing. Almost all of the pieces were flawless, a few were worn or faded in some way and the price reflected that. Brand names were bountiful; Banana Republic, Ralph Lauren, Chico's, Jones New York, Ann Taylor, American Eagle, H&M. There were also some wonderful vintage pieces from the 80s, bright colors and crazy shoulder pads that would have made a more adventurous fashionista very happy indeed!""The clothing smells wonderful, not musty or dirty as in some thrift stores, and there was even a large selection of plus-sized clothing carefully culled out in a special section.""I went to Red White & Blue to find some business attire for my new job, and came home with two gorgeous, flawless statement blazers from Ann Taylor Loft and Banana Republic... for a total of $7!""Come to this thrift store; it'll make all other shopping obsolete!""""Ever shopped at a Thrift Shop that sells high end labels, some brand new and gently used items like backpacks for $5? This is a great place to discover unique things. They also have daily deals such as 1/2 off of certain color tags. Have to dig through other things though to find something interesting which is part of the adventure!""First time i really took a moment to look for some stuff. It's always a Hit or miss, all the other thrift store I've visited later in my trip showed me that. Thrift store sure does drain a lot of your mental energy. Looking for stuff there was a hellacious project but I bought a Steeler jersey for 2.50$, some polos and a cute outfit for a friends baby. 20$ before reduction and after 7.90$!! wohh!! That felt good!!""I love a deal, and this has been my favorite thrift store since I was a kid.  ""First, there is some sort of half-off deal every day.""Second, the used book selection is pretty decent.  Yeah, there are a ton of self-help and Patterson mass markets that you have wade through, but T.C. Boyle for two bucks?  Yes, please.""Third, the home goods.  I've gotten huge solid wood picture frames for only a couple dollars.  The art prints inside were hideous...but I threw those away, re-stained the frames to my liking, cut new mats, and inserting art quoted as $360 each to frame at a big chain fabric store for under $30.  Boom.""Finally, there is a decent selection of lamp to re-wire, always lot of furniture, some diamond in the rough clothes on occasion, and lots of other wacky stuff that's just fun to sift through.""CASH ONLY and the cashiers are pretty rude/lazy, but that never bothers me.""BONUS:  They pick up your donations for free from your porch.  http://www.pickupplease.org/  Super easy.""""I love love LOVE this store. I thought the one on Saw Mill Run was great but this was i think is way awesomer. If only awesomer were a word. I love to go here and find lots of home decor items to decorate my house. candle holders, DIning sets, paints, sculptures and sooo much more. I found this small desk lamp that has a victorian look to it with the shade included for $4. The lamp shade was made of some kind of smooth material almost like leather. It's such a great find. There are plenty of items for sale at this place and most of them are in great shape. ""So the clothes which occupy most of the store are the best find. The Store has certain days that offer you %50 certain color tags. I went on a Monday and it was half off yellow and white tags. Other days its half off blue, or green or red. I love to go on Saturdays!! This past week it was half off every tag except white. I found so many items for such a cheap price. $7 shirts for $3.50 and tunics for $4. Have you ever find items for $1?? I have!!! I love when I find a great shirt or sweater for $3 or less. Or when you find a brand new item with the tags on them for under $7. I bought a brand new pair of Arizona Jeans (in my size) for $5. I couldn't believe it. I was too excited."The clothes are organized by color but not by size which is a good and bad thing. I like to shop by color since I don't wear too many yellows or purples. I can avoid those sections all together but when I do find a nice shirt in the color I want the size becomes an issue. There were a lot of nice shirt that were just too small or too big. Even when i have to pass on a nice shirt I tend to find one that's just as good at the same price. Shopping here is a gold find!! My sister was the one who introduced me to this store and i used to make fun of her for shopping thrift. If I had known that It was nothing like the Good Will I would have been here a lot sooner. Now my sister makes fun f me for going so often. What an amazing place this is!! I'll probably never shop retail again!!REMINDER: CASH ONLY!!"-But they have an ATM!! $2.50 fee""""My wife, my daughter and I went here for breakfast. I got the breakfast special: $5 for French toast and eggs. Clean, great service, delicious food. You can't beat it for breakfast."Place has amazing omelettes that are almost as big as the size of the plate. You get a really big side of home fries too. This is probably my favorite place for breakfast in Pittsburgh. I generally go in and get a seat right away without waiting. Service is usually fast and friendly. Two downsides to the place. 1) they are cash only which can be an inconvenience. I never remember to have cash until I get my bill so I have to run to the ATM. 2) the seating is limited and the tables are very close to each other so people there can most likely hear your conversations. Place overall is excellent and is worth a try at least for breakfast. The lunches and dinner selections aren't bad either!!Remember When.... I always do when I go to this ice cream shop... The oldies playing and the best and biggest ice cream in Pgh.. The large ice cream cone comes out the side door cause they can't fit out the window...WoW it's great and has been great for many many years.. Been going there since I was a young young lad I'm now 27 and take my family there we love it... Keep up the good work"This is by far, the BEST soft serve ice cream place in southwestern PA. The ""flavor of the week"" is always interesting-and tasty! Though, I am somewhat disappointed that they've switched to a lower grade ice milk, for their vanilla and chocolate offerings. I don't know if this is a matter of cutting corners, or if the better stuff simply isn't available any longer. Either way, this place is still leaps and bounds ahead of DQ, Tastee Freeze, etc. It's definitely worth the trip. It's mostly street parking, though they do have about 3-4 parking spaces off to the side. Serving sizes are huge! The small cone here, is the same size as a DQ large. And the large is SO big, they can't fit it through the window-they hand it out the side door.""If you want a real """"Kodak moment""""-order a large cone for the kids, and keep the camera, and wet wipes handy!"""Thank You Kim and Kurt! It was very nice of you guys to take the time to post your reviews on our service. We really appreciate it. We hope your clocks will continue to do well for years to come. Please dont hesitate to give us a call if there's anything else we can do for you.Lisa"Paul's Clock Repair""""Can't say enough good things about Paul's Clock Repair.  We inherited an old clock from my parents that had not worked for some time.  For a very reasonable price, Paul cleaned it up, replaced the broken springs and got it working.  When we picked it up, they took the time to show us the proper way to set it up and keep it working for years.  Thank you Paul's Clock Repair for restoring our family heirloom!!""I can not express my thanks & gratitude enough to everyone at Paul's Clock Repair.  I needed an Atmos clock repaired, which was given to me by my mother who had recently passed away.  I needed it done on a short time line since I live out-of-town and was leaving soon.  It is next to impossible to find anyone who can actually fix that type of clock especially anywhere close to where I live.  They were so accommodating and really really helped me out during a hard time.  Much thanks to Lisa for spending the time to teach my about the clock & how to take care of it and her dad for fixing it up!  My Atmos clock is now working great and looks wonderful on my mantle!""In my opinion, this is the best distributor in the city. The people running it are great, the selection is very good, and the prices are competitive with almost any other place I've been to. Because I'm not too picky, I typically have been stopping right at the front to buy the discounted brew that's usually out of season. You can't beat buying a case for $12.99. I'll continue to go here for my beer needs until I leave the city."Being from Illinois and in town to attend a Steelers game we needed beer.  Found out grocery stores only sell basically a 12 pack per person/visit. Nothing like Illinois where the sky's the limit. So after that education we ended up here.  Good selection of beer when you need more quantities that 2 six packs.  We stocked up on IC light and was reasonably priced.  Friendly service.  Only con is parking is scarce but that seems to be par for the course in Pittsburgh.  I would visit again if in the area."i was a vet tech for 6 years so I'm pretty particular about people caring for my pets. The groomer (becky) listened to what I wanted and did exactly what we had discussed. My dog always seems quite happy and relaxed after a grooming there. (a really good sign). Also, they are recommended by one of my favorite pet shops in Pittsburgh, Smiley's Pet Pad. I wholeheartedly trust Animal Elegance to take proper care of my little furry friends.""I use their services regularly. They in fact are the only place I will take my dog ""Gaffney"". The location is right off the main street.  She is always extremely well groomed when they are done.  They are worth the price.""This place is the best! We won't take our dog anywhere else for grooming. It's a very mom & pop type of place. They genuinely cared for our puppy, not to mention the perfect job they did on the cut and washing. Everyone who works here seems to treat the animals with the upmost care. Such a convenient location on Butler Street near Lawrencevillle. Can't wait to go back!! Thank you so much!!!""My favorite Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh.  All-time favorite dish:  eggplant parmesan with their spicy arrabbiata sauce, I had to ask for them to make it that way.  Not your typical layers of fried, heavy eggplant--lighter, chunkier eggplant that melts in your mouth.  My favorite appetizer there is the sizzling olives--they bring you a little cast iron skillet and throw olives in it--they soften and are so wonderful to eat!  Flavor explodes in your mouth!  Also good is ther roasted veggie platter and charcuterie plate.  We typically go on less crowded days, as the restaurant is small--but we've always had excellent service and the food comes out hot and fresh!"I like this place so much! Unpretentious. Everything is made from scratch. Service is amazing. Lots of small plates. Great wine deals... Definitely worth a trip."Six of us went to dinner, six of us had fabulous meals!  My husband said his seafood fra diavlo was the best he ever ate, not a bit fishy--loaded with fresh seafood and a spicy sauce.  My son had the carbonara which he described as fabulous.  My daughter had the roasted veggie platter as her meal (it is a large appetizer), and I also sampled it--the vegetables and olives were marinated and grilled perfectly.  My father had the skirt steak which he loved, and my son had a sausage pizza.  Both said they were delish!  I usually get the eggplant parmesan with their spicy arribiata sauce but this time I had a pasta dish loaded with artichokes and shrimp in a spicy sauce.  It was excellent!  ""It was my father's birthday, and they brought out a Tiramisu for us to share (we didn't even ask for it), and that was luscious as well!  The staff was as nice as can be--we will be back without a doubt!""I love this place!""""""God this is the best eggplant that I have ever tasted!""  was what our friend said after he took his first bite of the Sicilian eggplant served at Pino's.  My husband couldn't wait to have the seafood fra diavlo, which he had last time...again, a 10 out of 10!  I had the roasted veggie platter for my entree, which is really an appetizer--and I had to share--way too much for one person to eat.  Another comment from our friend (who was a first timer at Pino's) was that it was the best Italian dressing that he ever had.  As I write, I want to go back for dinner tonight!!""Forgot to mention, they also have local beers on tap (East End Brewery), the men enjoyed the Homewood brew (dark lager type beer), it's great to see the owners supporting local businesses!""""Another really good meal here!  My friend and I went for soup and appetizers--and licked the plates clean!  Gazpacho, pasta fagiole, homemade bread, eggplant with mozzarella and my favorite...the roasted veggie platter.  So much food we didn't think we would eat it, but it was so good we did!  They also had their doors open and we were able to sit outside in the cool summer air--great way to kick of summer!"New fall items on the menu--their grilled romaine salad is fabulous!Stopped in without a reservation around 7 pm. I ordered the house soup. It was very yummy. The soup was a tomato based soup with noodles and chick peas. I also tried the sausage flatbread. The flatbread sizing easily fed one. My boyfriend shared with me. The tomato sauce and peppers on it really made the flatbread. "I really one to come back int the summer when the front windows are opened and enjoy some wine and small dishesa""""There was absolutely nothing not to like.  Reasonably priced wines, home style Italian cooking. Great upbeat ambience."I live in Connecticut and visit family in Pittsburgh often. Pino's is my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant. "I don't have one favorite dish because I usually order one of the specials, which change often. I ordered from the regular menu for the first time a couple of weeks ago. The Bolognese sauce on tagliatelle pasta (I think the menu has it on rigatoni) was as good as what I had in Italy. My son had the seafood risotto. It was so good, I need to order it next time."My brother is a retired chef and hates to eat out because few restaurants are worth paying for what he can make better at home. He loved his meal and his tastes of everyone else's at the table (there were 10 of us). He was giddy to enjoy eating out for the first time in in a long time."Oh, they also make great cocktails and have a very, very nice wine list.""Oh, if you think you can only get good fries and mussels at the Belgium place around the corner, try Pino's. The fries are topped with crispy herbs... yum!""No, it isn't cheap. But, I'm happy to pay for quality.""""We had dinner and drinks tonight and it was great as usual. We have been here often, with couples, with family, and for a large family event. Service and food have always been top notch.""Had a really nice casual dinner at the bar with great wine. Great service at a nice, neighborhood place. The wild mushroom arugula flatbread was wonderful!""OMG- the most delicious meal! We started with a calamari appetizer that my husband agrees to but never really likes and he couldn't stop asking for more. Unique and delicious and a very large portion (this is something you want to split) but so reasonably priced considering. We both had the rosemary brined chicken with a mushroom Demi glacÃ© and smashed potatoes. The presentation was delightful and the the FOOD WAS SO GOOD. DELICIOUS!  Chicken was sliced thinly but, yet tender and flavors melded wonderfully. To beat that was the chocolate mouse - the chef specializes in pastries and there are not words made yet to describe the desert we had. We only know we are going to be going back - many times. THANK YOU PINOS!!!!!""I am so glad my daughter, aunt and myself  took a chance and tried this restaurant. Liz the waitress was so helpful and friendly. We had great wine and delicious meals. It was also a nice touch that the Chef came to our table to meet and greet. If you love homemade pasta, you will love this restaurant. We will definitely be back!""Can't recommend this barber highly enough.  I was in town, and walked over here.  I realized that they only take cash, but Paul Pirollo just says 'don't worry about it, bring it later'.  There were two guys waiting ahead of me.  It took a while because he does such a good job.  He was familiar with both men, and very friendly.  When he cut my hair, he took his time, and asked my opinion in a considerate way.  He detailed the edges of my hair with hot foam and a straight razor, and used some sort of eucalyptus-smelling post shave ointment. In talking to him I found out that he has been in this location for 53 years.  In all those years he has gotten damn good at his job. I told him 'I'll be right back with the money' and he said 'don't worry about it' come back with it any day'.  I did come right back with it, and gave him a $4 tip on a haircut that cost $15, but he really deserved more for this million-dollar haircut.""This is perhaps the best mechanic shop in Pittsburgh.  It is ran by two brothers and may not look like much but they offer excellent service, honest work and great pricing.  Recently I brought my truck in after another shop said I needed a litany of repairs.  At Bruno's they did only the necessary work and even fixed the ignition switch which had worn out and only charged me for the part.  These guys are great, but they are usually backed up with work so you may have to schedule in advance.""Bruno's is by far the best garage I've ever taken my car to, either here in Pittsburgh or in Los Angeles where I used to live. I drive a 2000 Saab, so believe me, I have A LOT of experience getting my car repaired. The two brothers who own Bruno's are great. They are very knowledgeable, they're very willing to help you and, above all, they're honest, which I've found is a  rare commodity when it comes to mechanics. I cannot possibly recommend Bruno's highly enough."Absolutely amazing guys here! We were in Pittsburgh visiting my family and the driver's seatbelt stopped working. Day after Thanksgiving and these guys got us in despite obviously being incredibly busy.  It turns out that a piece of plastic had gotten stuck in the buckle. Now we are able to drive home. Thanks!!!!!"It is the best mechanic shop I have been to in Pittsburgh.  I went there every year for inspections and every time my car had a problem.  Absolutely excellent service!! The most valuable things that I have found about this shop is the honesty and great price, as other people mentioned in their reviews.  The brothers who work there are very nice and honest. They are always ready to help.  There are a couple of times when it was just a tiny problem with my car, they fixed my car without charging me, and even refused to take my tip.  They always explained to me what problem my car had, gave me recommendations, and found the least costly way to fix it.  The only thing I wish they could've done better is setting up voicemail function for their phone, as the phone doesn't work sometimes. However, they are always in the shop from Monday to Friday when I drop by, even after I get off work at night around 5.   It's not easy to find trustworthy mechanics. I feel pretty lucky.  Definitely recommend to those who are looking for a good mechanic shop in Pittsburgh.""The best, most honest and reliable car guys in the Burgh. I lived in Pittsburgh for eight years and still have family there. I drive in from out of state so these guys can do work for me."Great service. I had my tail light replaced and had it bought online. Other places said that they wouldn't install something that wasn't bought at their place. Bastone finished the work very quickly and did a great job. Great service and value.I was passing through Pittsburgh and discovered a headlight was out.  I found Bastone through Yelp and drove over.  "They fixed the light on the spot charging me $12.  First impressions are great - very clean repair shop and the service for this minor repair was done in a friendly and welcoming manner.""""I have taken my cars to Bastone's for years and would highly recommend them.  Always friendly, always courteous, never trying to sell me on unnecessary work.   I really appreciate their honesty and their help in keeping my old car working and on the road.""Bastone is the best auto service I have found in the US.  I have trusted my car to them for all the years I have been in Pittsburgh and I do not plan on changing them.  They are very professional, logical prices, and they make everything possible to meet your time schedule if you ask them for.  They even give some perks for ""loyalty"" customers (e.g., free oil change for every 6 oil changes you do there - of course this means every 2.5-3 years but still).  The also have a shuttle to drop you off (I have never used it but I have seen other people using it).  However, because they are so good they are very busy too, so make an appointment ahead of time.  They are also not open during weekends.""Bastone was able to get my car into the shop the very day I was out looking to get my car repaired. Carl, the man who assisted me, was very friendly, addressed all my concerns, and called me with an estimate before doing work (front end and alignment). Compared to the horror stories you can read online, their prices are very reasonable. I picked up my car a few hours later and the steering is tight, dead-center, and hasn't felt this good to drive since I bought it. I will definitely be returning if any other problem with my car arises. Nice work guys."Perfect place! I needed help today and they helped me....no charge...just asked me to do something nice for somebody else today!The guys at Bastone are great. Everyone is friendly and knowledgable. We've brought our car in several times for both regular service and repairs and they always work quickly and provide a solution at a reasonable price. They're always very patient when we ask lots of questions. Our car has never been in better shape thanks to Bastone.I am emotionally attached to this place.This place has given me food and given me a place to go to early morning's when all the clubs are closed.:)"   The night starts by saying-""""It's Party Time"""" and eventually ends at Giant Eagle at times.Three cheers for Giant Eagle!!!

I stopped going to this place since I got a job at whole foods. My mom went here a two weeks ago for the first tine in a long time she say that the people are still there and the place looks better and the people are a lot friendly now. "So if you don't what too shop at a Middle Class food store in East Liberty then go to The Market in Shadyside.""""According to Urbanspoon (blasphemy I know) their are like 1,100 pizza places in pittsburgh. So what is the best pizza in Pittsburgh. Everyone has an opinion and so here is mine: The best pizza in Pittsburgh is the pie comes from the place in you neighborhood that has quality ingredients, fair prices, and friendly service. Eddie's Pizza Place  is all of these things and since I live in this neighborhood this is my favorite.""Had a fair bit of work done to my car after a winter's worth of ice landed on the hood.  Excellent work, not the fastest but the end result was impeccable."Was referred here by my mechanic to have my front bumper replaced. Had it done quickly and inexpensively. Even drove my wife to work when she dropped it off. Called on my way there to pick it up and asked about an estimate on a scratch along the side of my car. When I got there they had an estimate printed out but they just finished buffing out the scratch and touching it up for free. Looks great. Also compounded my headlights because they were yellowing for free. Very impressed!"Great results, great people, great customer service. I've brought my car in to this shop three times, and my husband has used it once. They do excellent, honest work here and are so friendly and knowledgeable that I know I can come in for car body advice at any time. I wish I could give them more business, but I'm leaving the state. Will miss this place. Never thought I'd say that about a body shop.""Super nice guys. They ended up doing a number of simple things for free and they're not afraid of complex jobs. If you need help with your door hinges, come here.""My wife and I have been going here for as long as we have lived in Pittsburgh, which is about 10 years.  This is our go-to Chinese restaurant, even after we moved out of the neighborhood.  I have never had a bad meal here, and I will forever love their beef chow fun!  My wife and I are moving to North Carolina in two days, and Tasty Chinese was the thing about Pittsburgh that we said we would miss the very most.  These are great folks, and I wish them the best of success in the future.  Remember, everyone, just because you read a negative review it does not mean that the food is bad!  Some people just have lousy taste buds, and many people have no idea what they are ordering to begin with.  Try things for yourself, and you will find some great food at Tasty!""Tasty is Pittsburgh's BEST kept secret for Cantonese cuisine. If you're Chinese and miss your mum's cooking, this is the place to go!!! The service is fast, the food is cheap and they serve you gummies to end of the meal! Did I mention that there's a designated parking lot right infront of the store?""Don't order the American standards of General Tso's and Moo Goo Gai Pan , unless you REALLY want to. This is the place to get really authentic home cooked food. Order the steam ground pork, or steam ground pork with egg, the tofu, veggie and mushroom dish on the special menu written in Chinese( second from the right), the cold steamed chicken with ginger, or the chicken with mushroom, or the pork chop with pepper sauce, or the shrimp with egg and the list goes on. ""If you have an occasion, say a graduation dinner, the restaurant will even roast you a duck (yum!), or stir fry up some lobster with ginger and scallions ( big yum!) or stew you some pork with lotus root soup ( super yum!). And they will arrange the tables nicely, and cover them up with some festive table cloth. The owners are also really accomodating with regards to changing the menu at short notice and special requests. If you need to refrigerate a cake, they will gladly oblige. They do not serve alcohol, its a BYOB place. The BEST part, a ten course dinner for 11 people will set you back about $120 or so including tax and tip (menu included roast duck and lobster)!  ""My husband and I have been eating at this little hole in the wall for years now and we are really going to miss it when we move.  The owners are really nice and the food is great!"""Home of the Italian Army.I grew up on Vento's and have been coming since they were in their old location when Sears was still there before Home Depot was built.Vento's is located in the East Liberty section of Pittsburgh right next to Home Depot. They have been in business forever! They are a pizza and hoagie shop. They are famous for their Italian Army hoagie. I have friends that as soon as they land in Pittsburgh they come straight to Vento's for the pizza! It is Sicilian style pizza and It is delicious! Everything is made fresh so sometimes you have to wait a little while for your food. It's best to call ahead if you're really hungry.They have tables and booths for seating. You can even play the PA lottery there. No debit or credit cards. CASH ONLY!"(F.Y.I. There is a generic ATM that charges $1.75 to make a withdraw.)""""I love the history and the atmosphere..

I love Literally ALL food Sean the chef Makes... The Secret Sauce is phenom on Calzones too..""""Ventos is an East End tradition.   The Sicilian style pizza is the bomb!   It is more of a traditional working-class Pittsburgh style crust.  It comes square, and bread like.  Think of men coming home from the steel mill with their thick crusty slices of square sauce & cheese pizza, circa 1955.  ""If you prefer the doughy (Dominos or similar) kind of pizza crust, sickeningly sweet sauce (Papa Johns) or brick oven 'designer' pizza you might not like Vento's pizza.  It's a workingclass style of pizza in a workingclass neighborhood.  Personally, I happen to love Vento's pizza-my dad worked in steel mills all of his working days, lol.  They also have subs, and other items like deep fried mushrooms.  This is a blue collar  establishment in a an urban working-class neighborhood,  Ventos is the real deal.   Everything I've had from here is hearty & good."""What a wonderful hidden gem!"My boyfriend and I have been here twice and we have raved about it both times.  The service is wonderful - the employees are patient, kind and helpful.  The food isn't 5 star, but it IS really really good and, best of all, cheap as hell!""Sure the pizza may not be cut into """"pizza shape,"""" but that doesn't make it any less wonderful at all.  Everything I have ever had here is wonderful and I will definitely be taking multiple 30 minute trips back here to support this independent business."""Place is amazing.food is made to order but it comes out fresh and hot!"Pizza is square cut and the corners are the best.""""The food quality is good or not great.

Not only do the do great work, but the experience is great to. The shop is clean and comfortable. They have a contests with enterprise so you can pick up and drop off a rental there. They even give you a can of glass cleaner and snacks when you pick up your car. They have fantastic customer service."I had to choose from a list of insurance-approved body shops to get my car repaired after an accident. Mike's Auto Body was nearby and more highly rated than other convenient options. They did not disappoint. The turnaround time was quick (less than 3 days) and they did a great job! My car looks as though the accident never happened and I am quite pleased with the work. They had to fix a large dent and some scraped paint."The neighborhood the shop is located in is not great (some interesting """"characters"""" soliciting in the intersection nearby), but the shop itself is clean and comfortable. I did not feel unsafe going to and from the shop in daylight.""The customer service was excellent, as well. Everyone I interacted with was professional and courteous. I was continually updated with progress on my repairs and they were actually finished a day earlier than expected. I hope I don't need to go back to Mike's for repairs, but I would definitely choose them again in the event of an accident!""""I was rear-ended with not too serious damage in July 2013.  Since my car is new I really wanted my dealer to do the repairs.  Geico sent me to Mikes and since their claims adjuster was in situ as was Enterprise this was too easy to pass  up.  I was dubious but they really did an excellent job.  They finished in only a few days, they were polite and my car was clean when I picked it up. Neighborhood is sketchy but I didn't have any problems. I'd recommend this place to anyone.""The people that work here make an unfortunate incident a breeze to work through.  I woke up one morning to find a note attached to my windshield to inform me that I was the victim of a hit and run.  The damage was minimal, but after calling it into my insurance company, they directed me to come here."Within minutes of me hanging up my phone with the insurance company my phone was ringing to indicate that Mikes was calling to set up an appointment to get my car in for an estimate.  I set up an appointment that was convenient for me and went about my day."When I arrived here to have my car viewed it was quite the easy task.  My wait was minimal, the staff were polite and I wasn't being jerked around.  Within five minutes of them looking at my car, I was out the door and heading back to my place.  ""Unfortunately, they did not do any work to my vehicle at this point because the police are still looking into the person that hit my car.  But if we get to that step, I am confident that they could not do anything wrong in my eyes.  If their body work for a vehicle is anything like their customer service, they are definitely one of the best places to go in the city.""Yes people, this isn't the best neighborhood in the city, but get over it.""""Mike's doesn't really need another stellar review on here, but I'll give them another one anyway.""I'm a choir director at a church, and after rehearsal a few weeks ago, one of my choir members ran into my car in the parking lot and crunched the rear bumper. Bummer...""I had never had to file an insurance claim before, and wasn't really sure what to expect. Dealing with Mike's was about as easy as it gets. I called to set up an appointment for the estimate and drove down a few days later. I was only there about 10-15 minutes and got sent on my way.""A few days after that (Monday), I took my car in for the repair. It did take a couple days longer than they said, which is really the only negative thing I can say about Mike's, but considering I didn't have to pay for the rental car, it wasn't a huge deal. When I did get my car back (Thursday), like others have said, it was in even better condition than when I took it in (besides the dent, of course)! They had cleaned/waxed the outside, and even cleaned and detailed the inside! If they just did detailing, I would take my Impreza there every time! Mike's rules!"""Mikes took my car after horrible repairs/service from Kenny Ross South.  The service was great and I even got to meet the owner who came out to personally speak with me on a busy Friday afternoon.  Great guys there."I had a great experience taking my vehicle to Mike's for repair after a fender bender. I used the Geico express service - I booked the estimate and repair online for the next day. When I dropped off my car, they were expecting me, it took less than 30 minutes and every single person I encountered at the shop was helpful and friendly and showed concern for me. The damage was minor, and the repairs took less than 48 hours to complete. My policy provides a rental car, and Enterprise was there when I checked in with my vehicle and the rental process was streamlined and easy. When I picked up my repaired car, it was just as efficient and friendly. Getting into an accident is frustrating and inconvenient and costly but Mike's Auto Body made the process of fixing things and getting me back on the road into a good experience. I wish more businesses treated their customers like Mike's treated me.""Mikes did an awesome job on my SRX after I dented it backing into my garage. The insurance claim  adjuster was on site as well as one of Mikes professionals to meet me when I brought the car in.  They reviewed the damage , gave me a solid estimate and took the car right then. They kept me informed of the progress of the repair. The car looks amazing and they even left a gift bag in the car with a variety of  car care products and other good things as a thank you . the repair took a little longer than originally estimated but the quality of workmanship was well worth the wait. Thank you Mikes!""Had a great experience at Mikes. I backing into a loading dock, which completely shattered my taillight and dented my side panel. I'm a college student so naturally I was very upset and worried to see how much it would cost. They made me feel comfortable and gave me a great price for the repair which only took a couple of hours! Definitely would go back again.""They did a  fantastic job on my car. I did not go through insurance so of course it cost more than I was hoping. Also my car was in the shop an extra day or two than expected. But DO NOT GET ME WRONG they do quality work, fair price, and Paul and both of the receptionists I spoke with, are as friendly as can be. They even fixed things that a different body shop in Texas messed up on; Mikes body shop fixed their mistake for under $12. I highly recommend them to anyone. Even tho they are not in the best of neighborhoods, they do quality work for a reasonable price and they even wash, vacuum and buff your car for free. ""Ps- they warranty all of their work the entire time you own your vehicle""""I took my car here after a pretty nasty fender bender I was involved in. I initially came here because they were approved and recommended by my insurance carrier, GEICO. All I can say is how over the top impressed I was with the entire operation. First off the area I was greeted in was VERY clean and welcoming. I was treated promptly and respectfully by the staff. Given a realistic quote, including some extra work I wanted to have done while the car was being worked on. I know some people on here have complained about the work taking extra time, but mine was done a little sooner than anticipated. It was the morning of instead of end of the day quoted, but I'll take it. The car looked amazing too. The work was absolutely top notch.""The kicker for me though was I did not have rental policy on my insurance, so Mike's provided me with a loaner car for the duration of the repairs. What AMAZING customer service. I can't recommend these guys highly enough.""""I never grew up with a pet so getting one was a new experience. I had always heard kill/no-kill shelters whatever... I got my new dog Crosby from ARL which happens to be a ""kill shelter"". Thinking about this, I felt truly good getting him there because I felt as though I was saving him from some other destiny. However, he is so cute that I'm sure someone else would have adopted him...""The shelter itself is large and the volunteers and vet-techs that you interact with are very friendly. The dogs are constantly walked and you can tell the animals receive a ton of love from the staff. Adoption is made easy unless you rent in which case you should probably bring a letter from your landlord stating you are allowed to adopt. Another perk is that when Crosby had """"kennel cough"""" we went after hours to get him some medication and they still let us in and treated him...In short, great adoption experience at ARL.""""I adopted my dog, Paco, a pitbull mix on Memorial day weekend. He was a crazy wild dog, that had been returned twice before. He clearly needed some work, but was a sweet, handsome boy, and I couldn't pass him up! ""The ARL offered us help in free obedience classes, and also offered us a donated crate. We ended up taking him to Pat Moloney's K9 Academy to finish his training, and with a lot of hard work and dedication, he is a FANTASTIC dog, and a great companion.""The ARL facility was very nice and clean, the staff was helpful, and it is a product of it's volunteers for sure! They were all helpful and seem to know Paco as we walked him out of the shelter!"Things I liked most about the ARL:Helpful staff & volunteersClean environmentMeet & Greet roomsOutside play area to observe the dog off leashOn-site vet/clinicSmall store to purchase necessities"On-site training, and helpful tips from staff regarding training""They care. All of them. From staff to volunteer, they all care and it shows."Things I disliked:"Nothing."""I'm a crazy cat lady and proud of it! "Being a volunteer here has been so fulfilling on many different levels.  It has made me feel so good to be able to help out with something that I feel passionately about.  You can tell that the staff puts a lot of effort into taking care of these animals they accept in.  A lot of times people will say, oh I can't do it, it's too sad.  But the thing is, it's not.  It's actually so great because these animals come here and find loving homes instead of being on the street or in an environment that's toxic.  I rarely see animals there for a long time.  I think that's a testament to the way they are treated while they're in the facility. ""Now I'll admit, I'm not the biggest dog fan, so I help out in the cat shelter.  I can talk about that with a lot more knowledge than the dog side.  They just built a new cat facility on their property so they have their own shelter.  The cats are all set up in a huge room.  They have two rooms for people to play with the cats when they are looking to adopt them.  These rooms are also used for """"cat cuddling.""""  That's what I do when I volunteer.  I get to take the cats out so that they can play, be cuddled or just run around.  Then the cats are able to get out of the cages and get used to human contact. ""The other great thing about the ARL is that they have foster parents who take in cats and dogs while they're waiting to be adopted.  This way, they get a great home environment and it relieves the facility of having too many animals at one time. At different points in the year the adoption rates are different depending on the amount of animals they have.  Cat rates are usually cheaper in the Spring/Summer because there's more coming in and dog rates are cheap in the late summer months.  The added bonus of adopting a pet from the ARL is that they are spade or neutered when you adopt them.  It's actually cheaper then taking them to a normal vet on your own. "I would STRONGLY recommend coming here to check out the animals and hopefully find your next furry friend!  OR you can volunteer!  They have volunteer informational sessions the first Saturday of every month.  After that you only have one training session to complete and you're ready to volunteer!  "Just check it out if you're curious.  You won't regret it!  Your new furry friends will appreciate it as well!"""I have an almost three-year-old cat named Jack that I spoil as if he were my son. I honestly never experienced the love for and from an animal until I adopted Jack from an Animal Rescue League. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made."The shelter is great and I'll probably get another cat in the near future. Check this location out!""""A few years ago, I decided that I wanted to get a pet and so I volunteered at the ARL for a number of months in order to learn about the different breeds of cats and dogs. It was an invaluable experience and really helped me to learn about dog behavior. I still serve as a cat foster from time to time."The staff here have a tough and sometimes heart-breaking job. It's not  for the faint of heart but they're all very nice and do their best by the animals and the people who come in to adopt and surrender the poor beasts."Ultimately, I didn't get my doggy from the ARL (sometimes the heart doesn't get give you a choice) but my experiences there have really taught me a lot about animals and have only served to heighten my love for my 10yr old rescue pup."""Great place to find a dog or a cat"On July 16th our family was delighted to adopt ""Bubbles"" from the Animal Rescue League.  She is a wonderful, well mannered, eager to please dog. Over the past year we have been looking for just the right dog for our household  which includes 3 generations and a cat who rules.  We had visited ARL a few times in the past year. The staff and volunteers have always been friendly and knowledgeable about the animals.  They truly care about matching each cat or dog with the right  forever home.  I am horrified by the vehemence of the July 13 negative review posted.  Yes, the ARL is not perfect; but the staff and volunteers are terribly overwhelmed and they honestly try to do their best.  The solution lies in  more volunteers and more funding.  I highly recommend going to ARL when you want to adopt a pet or wish to volunteer your time to a very worthy organization.""I adopted another cat in February and both my cats are the best of friends. It took a while to get there, but trust me, they're pals now.""Adopt an animal today!""""I volunteer as a dog coach twice a week and i am absolutely in love with the ARL. There are two beautiful babies, whom I have walked for weeks, that I wanna mention (these ladies would be mine if I didn't already have a grumpy Basset and an elderly Shiz zhu @ home):""Bunny (my girl!! Bunny ears, and the sweetest temperament):"http://www.animalrescue.org/available-pets"Honey (I love her to death, 6 years old, just wants to be loved!!):"http://www.animalrescue.org/available-pets"Stop by the ARL! It is worth the trip. :)"""I have gotten two great dogs from ARL over the years the staff is polite and really cares about the animals and finding them the right home. They get the animals the best vet care they can and i believe they have an on site clinic. I would suggest even if they have a special on adoption prices pay the full amount if you can.  From what I see they take great care of the animals and could use all the money they can to make sure this continues."I could never stop saying good things about the Animal Rescue League! As other reviewers have pointed out, going there both breaks and warms your heart.  I adopted my puppy, Brock, back in January, and I couldn't be happier.  The staff was super helpful and very kind. They gave us enough time to make sure Brock was the right dog for us, and also made sure we knew what we were getting ourselves into. (Brock is a husky mix, so he's a ball full of energy. Great running buddy! :) ) ""I will most definitely be back and plan on telling all friends considering a pet to adopt from the ARL!""""A few years ago, I lost my partner and love of my life in a tragic accident.  While struggling with my horrific grief and having difficulty getting back into life as I once knew it, my grief counselor suggested that I ""help something else"" in order to help myself feel better.  We decided that since I was an animal lover I would try volunteering at an animal shelter.  I was not working, so I had a lot of time and wanted the shelter to feel right.  I visited a few, they all do good work, but the one that kept drawing me back was the ARL.  Yes, the building is old, it's a bit run down, but that doesn't stop the staff and administration from doing the best they can with so very little and in not the best of space.  I saw a bathroom be ""renovated into a vet tech office, I saw the janitor's closet renovated and made in to the ""rodent room.""  Where cats once lived in cages along the halls of the ARL a new building next door, an old gas station was made into the ""Cat Adoption Center!""  When you have staff that are still young and are going on 5-10 years + at the same shelter, (same place of employment for that matter) you know something about the place is right!  I volunteer easily 30 hours a week at the ARL, I get to see the good, the bad and the ugly, and I can tell you first hand that the good is in the staff, the Executive Director, Dan Rossi, and all of the work that goes on for the animals.  The staff knows EVERY one of the animals, they do all they can to care for them, and keep the doors WIDE open for both domestic and wild animals, even if that means a staff member or volunteer takes a cat or dog home!  The answer is never ever ""no"" to any animal.  I also volunteer for the Humane Society of the United States and travel around the countryside working on dogfighting raids, cruelty, hoarding, natural disasters, and the ARL has never said no to me when I ask to bring animals back from incredibly sad or inhumane situations.  Technically, by the numbers, it is a ""no-kill"" shelter, because it is open door people will often call it a ""kill shelter.""  Yes, sometimes an animal does have to be euthanized.  The ARL is the Animal Control shelter for the city of Pittsburgh and with that can bring some very upsetting and disturbing signs of animal cruelty.  It can also mean it's the dog who just bit a kid that you just saw on the news.  The ARL has an obligation to society to not let dangerous dogs back on the street, to euthanize when a dog is very sick or is very aggressive to humans or other animals, and trust me, I have held many of those dogs as they are put to sleep and I always am so thankful that the vet staff we have are so compassionate and do the euthanasia in the most humane manner.  That's a tough job, it's heartbreaking, but in some cases it has to be done for the good of the animal and for the safety of society.  I admire the work and staff of the ARL and will continue to devote my time to them and thank them for the wonderful work they do on behalf of the city of Pittsburgh and all of the wild and domestic animals alike.  We are so lucky to have them in our area and as our city shelter.""The ARL is great! Earlier in the month, we mistakenly adopted 2 pit bulls. After they killed my rabbit and got loose a few times, we felt they were too much and gave them up. The people who worked there were really understanding and asked us a lot of questions so as to provide the best care for them until they are hopefully adopted by the right people.  Sorry Chloe and Coco. :( ""They are a NO-KILL shelter too. Always a huge plus.""""I adopted a dog from the ARL this past spring.  During the adoption process the employees were polite and seemed genuinely happy for me.  Shortly after the adoption, I received emails from a volunteer to check in and to inquire about how the dog and I were adjusting.  A few months after the adoption, it became clear that the dog had some pretty serious anxiety and behavioral issues (please note that there is no way the shelter staff could have known about the issues while the dog was in the shelter).  I contacted the shelter and they practically  bent over backwards to help me with the dog's issues.  The dog and I participated in two sessions of behavioral classes (Lacey is wonderful and never gave up on my dog!), consulted with veterinary staff, and received constant emails from staff offering suggestions and checking in to see how I was doing.  In the end, I learned how to manage the dog's behaviors and I love the dog dearly.  Nine months later, I still receive emails from the shelter asking about the dog and offering more suggestions.""I would highy suggest adopting from this shelter.  I understand that my dog is sort of a worse-case-senerio of adopting a pre-owned dog; however, this shelter will make sure you are happy with your adoption and literally will do everything in their power to ensure both you and the adopted animal are ok.  The shetler staff care deeply about the animal AND the human's well-being!""""I've had such good experiences with ARL, that I will probably return here again and again.  Years ago we adopted a mutt of a puppy that turned out to be the best dog that I could have ever imagined.  But let me talk about my most recent visit.""While browsing Facebook, I noticed that they were having an event at ARL.  This particular event was called the Free Fur All.  The event involved free adoption to qualified adopters, free micro-chipping for any pet (adopted there or elsewhere), free dog baths, and goodies for both human and furry companions.""I had plans to get Little Man E microchipped during his appointment to take his manhood away (don't worry, we've talked about it and he is fine by it), but when this popped up and said it was free.  Hot damn, you know I was in line.  It's also probably one of the more easy and humane ways to keep ties on your dog or cat just in case they were to run off one night.""Once we were registered, we waited at most for 15 minutes.  It's a very quick thing to have done.  Little Man E didn't even flinch.  He was more amused by his reflection in the table than that little pinch behind the shoulder blade.  I have to give huge kudos to the staff there.  They are so very friendly to not only you, but your pet.  It's like they talk their language.  I also have to thank them because while we were there, LME somehow ripped his one toenail and they were kind enough to clip as much of it off as they could (no extra charge either!).""Once done, we just walked outside to see what was up (E skipped the bath).  We visited one of the tables and E selected a ball and bandanna and we decided to head out after that.""This place is amazing for so many different pet oriented things.  I'll definitely be coming back here whenever I need something for LME."""This place is PHENOMENAL.I got my bunny here a few months ago and the ladies were so nice and helpful and they take SUCH good care of the animals.  They gave me a bit of hay and food for her that lasted me close to three months.  Then when we were leaving we saw a cage of six dwarf hamsters and they gave us a deal of 2/$10."I love my animals so much and I will always check here first for pets before anywhere else."""I adopted two cats from animal rescue league and my cats are healthy and happy. They take care of animals with love and kindness. They are of course so busy because there are many abandoned pets from irresponsible humans.."But they made the whole adoption process easy and after almost a year my cats are still lovely and gives me so much love.""""I just adopted my second dog from this shelter, I think they're wonderful! You must keep in mind that no rescue shelter is going to look like a 5 Star hotel and be able to keep every animal free from illness, but the ARL does a great job. All pets are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, and receive a microchip. Your first vet visit after your adoption is half-off their already cheap prices at their in-house vet clinic. They also give you a little goodie bag along with the pets vet records.  I'm so thankful for the furry friends I've adopted from the ARL!"Everyone I have encountered here is amazing. You can tell they are passionate and dedicated when it comes to their job. I adopted a kitten here at the end of the summer and she is absolutely perfect. You can tell that she was loved & cared for while in their care. "I took her for a 6 month check up recently and the vet was so nice. He took time to look over her and was genuinely kind to me and my mom. Sometimes people who work with animals lose their people skills, but this guy was great. It's waaaaay out of my way, but I'd definitely take Lily back there for any problems that arise. Well worth the drive.""""We recently lost our beloved cat, and our hearts are still broken. I couldn't stand our house without a cat, so I begged my husband to go look at kittens. We knew we wanted a shelter cat, so we went to the ARL. ""It was a wonderful experience. The volunteers were very helpful. We were holding kittens in the kitten room, but the one we seemed to really like was very nervous. They allowed us to take her into another room, and checked on us numerous times.""They were extremely busy and short-staffed, but efforts were still made to make sure we were able to bond with the kitten. They weren't pushy, and they were very patient.""Once we made our decision to adopt, they whisked us over to the main building. The whole process took about 20 minutes. The staff really cares about the well being of their animals. It's great place!""""The Animal Rescue League is simply the friendliest, most human and pet friendly shelter in the city. I cannot thank them enough for allowing me to adopt my new little buddy. ""I was able to meet and greet with the cat that I was looking to adopt, and spend some time with him in a secluded play area. His foster was there to ask some questions about what I was looking for in a cat and if I had any experience with cat care. All pretty standard for what you should expect before rescuing a new family member. ""The adoption process was super easy, the paperwork was standard and nothing intrusive or out of the ordinary. The adoption counselors were very thorough with the paperwork and answered any and all questions I had about my kitty's health and history. And all-in-all, I was able to take him home the same day I filled out the paperwork. "This place is great and takes wonderful care of their animals. I would highly recommend them be your first stop for adopting. Score out of Five: Friendliness: Five stars!Customer Service: Five stars!Ease of Adoption Process: Five stars!"Would I ever recommend them? Absolutely!""""I had a great experience! I needed to get a dress quickly tailored for an event. I was flying out of town in two days, and he was able to tailor the straps for me in time. I picked up the dress two hours before my flight and it fit perfectly. And its quite cheap! I asked a different place for the same service and they asked for $20 more than Topline. I highly recommend this place."Vincent provides the expert tailoring that is all but gone these days. He is the best tailor in Pittsburgh. He takes his time and does it right. I highly recommend Topline because of the expertise of Vincent and his wife and the quality of their work.While looking for a rental after relocating Rockwel was extremely helpful and courteous.  They were very responsive and accommodating with the right deadline my wife and I were under.  They were willing to go above and beyond to get the place prepped in time. Couldn't recommend them more."We have been living in our apartment with this company for more than 8 years & really love it. This is an OLD building-- about 90 years old. It has great character & a lot of quirks. That's what we like about it! The building is well maintained but one can expect things to go wrong in any home this old. The folks at Rockwel Realty are extremely responsible & responsive to our calls. Most things are resolved within a day & real emergencies are responded to immediately. For example, we've had a broken water heater that was replaced the same day; last winter when the weather was below zero for several days in a row & we had a broken water pipe, the landlord was over in 5 minutes. A plumber was over within an hour. ""The landlords keep the property clean, landscaped, and in working order and are pleasant, trustworthy, and dependable.""""On my recent road trip from Dallas to New Haven, CT, Randy S. and I stopped in Pittsburgh to revel in its charms. This, I must add, was in opposition to his mother's strong protests to the effect of, ""There's nothing *in* Pittsburgh, why would anyone go there?"" ""Tazza D'oro is the answer to that question. Especially if you like coffee. This is easily one of the best coffee shops east of the Mississippi, and I've been to a lot of them. So, what's so good about it?"Let's go in order of importance:"Coffee - It is really, really good. They use Batdorf and Bronson beans, where an ex-gf of mine used to work in Olympia. Believe me when I tell you that B&B is good. It's not amazingly great, but it's very solid and they take roasting seriously. When I go to a new coffee place I suspect might be good I always get a latte. Why? This one has a high upside if done well and the lowest downside (lots of milk) if done poorly. I got a latte. They have a few sizes, 12oz was the first one I got. It was fantastic. They did a nice little rosetta in it too (look up latte art on google if you have no idea what this is). The baristo really knew what he was doing and pulled a some good shots with excellent crema. ""The coffee was so good (coffee is supposed to taste bold, smooth and rich, which it almost never does and this place had it down) I had to go back for an 8oz, which is another level of trust. It has the same amount of coffee but less milk to hide poor coffee quality. It was always superior. ""This is a coffee place that is truly top notch based on the coffee alone, but there was more. ""Pastries - They all looked amazing. I had a plain donut while I waited in line. Normally I don't eat plain donuts, because life is too short for plain donuts, but it was really, very good. Everyone was commenting on how nice the pastries were.""Atmosphere - This place has it exactly right. It's a mom & pop feel, nothing forced. Some tables, outdoor seating, maybe some local art, but not in a goofy sort of way. Very friendly employees. Just a complete home run. ""Obviously I loved it. Behind me in line for my re-up, I heard a girl behind me in line complain, """"we could just go to Starbucks, it's cheaper!"""" then proceeded to order with sugar free syrups and skim milk. That's fine. Everyone has to do what they like... and with the proliferation of bad coffee (Starbucks only being guilty of mediocre, though a little bit interesting coffee) over the past 10 years, I don't blame people for being set that way. But the beautiful thing about Tazza D'Oro (cup of gold in Italian) is that--if you let it--it will remind you that you don't need to make your coffee up like a drag queen on Halloween.""Tazza D'Oro stands as a reminder that coffee can be enjoyed in all its naked glory in an awesome setting on a beautiful street and give you a good f'ing reason to go to Pittsburgh."""This is one of my two favorite coffeehouses in town. It took me far too long to come around and love Tazza D'oro. A horrible ex of mine loved this place and I admit that this soured me. I regret the time I wasted not going here. The dark wood inside comforts me. The small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer. "Tazza D'Oro brews Batdorf and Bronson beans (amazing), provides Enrico pastries (amazing) free wireless (amazing) and one of the most talented and friendly staffs I've ever met (amazing). Everyone who works there is *so* nice and *so* good at what they do. ""They have a small menu of local/fresh food that looks amazing, but I have never actually eaten it. The espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at Batdorf and Bronson locations in Olympia, WA. I talked about this with one of the barristas at TD'o and they were offended - """"we calibrate our machines the same, we use the same beans, the exact same blends and milks and everything, it can't be different."""" Sorry, Tazza D'oro, you are better. ""The lines get long on weekend mornings, but they move quickly. There's a sense of community nestled here, just off the """"main drag"""" of Highland Park, between Bryant st. and the reservoir. This is where you can pick up your CSA shipment for the week, where multiple weekly bike rides originate, where there are lively discussion groups meeting nearly every day. The percentage of students is low. Like the rest of Pittsburgh, there's a good chance you'll run into someone you know, but generally I see people I like and miss, which is different than the norm in Pittsburgh for me.""""Do you see how all of the other reviews give this place 5 stars - this place is way more than a 5 star coffee shop.  I am giving all 5 stars to this delightful coffee shop because it is the perfect community coffee shop.  I am slightly saddened that they took out the 2 overstuffed chairs, but they need more tables because people like to come here and people hanging out in their community is a good thing.  It is 11:30 on a Monday morning and the place is almost full - there are always people coming going, getting coffee."It is a great place to sit and read the paper or to pick up some coffee on your way to some place else.Enrico's also has become a hub for other community activities - there a a couple of weekly bike groups that meet here.Other reasons to love this place (I know some of the other reviews highlighted these but I thought they were worth repeating).- free wifi- outside tables- tasty treats- they have a blog!- really great coffee"- the staff are coffee experts""""Although I am not a coffee drinker, I do love their iced mochas!  They have wonderful teas, cider, hot chocolate.  The servers are wonderful and the brownies, as big as your head, are like crack.  Amy, the owner, has created a wonderful place for community.""Tazza D'Oro has a generally European decor, with dark, rich colors and textures, and a cozy layout that makes the most of the space. The espresso is, bar none, the best I've had - including my admittedly limited travels in Italy. It's stellar espresso - rich, thick, potent without being sour or bitter, with unique nuances that vary slightly depending on the shot and the weather, but are always fantastic.""The coffee is also terrific, and Tazza D'Oro uses Batdorf & Bronson beans - the best I've ever had for home grinding. They have a good selection of pastries and cookies, as well as a broad selection of tasty sandwiches that come with a satisfying side salad.""In addition, they have a wonderful selection of teas; I'm no expert, and don't know their supplier, but the half-dozen different blends I've tried were all memorably flavorful.""All that, and it's a lovely center of community, where you can bring your laptop or a book or a friend and spend the day. No one is rushed out the door, and there almost always seems to be a little room for your studies or conversation."""Best independent coffeeshop I've ever had the pleasure to visit."Best americano I've ever had.  Some of the best espresso I've ever had.  Great desserts, pastries, and cookies.  Good food.  The employees are awesome.""The owner apparently put the shop there because their neighborhood didn't previously have anything like it.  The shop is also all about bicycling as transportation, sponsoring regular group rides around town, and also group walks for those not bicycle-inclined.""""I LOVE this place. THE best coffee in the 'Burgh. Good atmosphere, great service. The food is really good too.""One of my favorite coffee places in Pittsburgh. THey also have pretty good sandwiches and salads if you are looking for some light lunch food. Otherwise, they have plenty of pasteries/cookies to eat that are pretty good."Some of the best coffee I've ever had.  Ever."Stick with an Italian Cappuccino and bring a good friend for some good conversation.""""Quick service, amazing coffee, nice vibe.""I love this place, its warm and cozy ambiance and the coffee and baked goods are wonderful!  The staff is so inviting too!""This is some of the best coffee I've ever had. I've been looking for a local coffee shop that made good coffee and didn't have irritating quirks in their service (I've run into a cash-only, lame hours shop and a we-don't-have-an-espresso-machine shop, which are useless to me.)""The pastry I had was good, though a bit overpriced at ~$3. The mocha I had was absolutely amazing, though their largest size is only 16 oz, which is an adjustment if you're expecting the larger sizes some other coffee shops produce."""The coffee here was excellent! Had a double espresso. Apparently their roaster is in Santa Cruz Ca. Large selection of French Press Coffees. Baked goods did not look too great but that is not why I came here. Atmosphere is very mellow and comfortable. Also has Wifi which works! Nice to find a place like this when traveling. Is in the middle of a residential area and there doesnt seem to be anything else around here."They just opened a spot at Carnegie Mellon, on campus in the Gates building and it has changed my life. My closest coffee option before was Seattle's Best, so you can imagine how delighted I was when this opened next door to where I have class all day.  The first week they were open I think I went there about 4 times.  The Italian Cappuccino will wire you for a few hours, but is totally amazing.  Their basic coffee pales in comparison to their espressos though, so stick with espresso drinks. I have also had two delicious paninis, which I highly recommend.  Knowledgeable service. Great drinks! yum!""I love Tazza D'Oro! great coffee, excellent baked goods and the food is delicious."This cafe's espresso drinks are on par with the best artisinal coffee houses anywhere.  I always go out of my way to get coffee from here when I'm in Pittsburgh."I love tazza.. Their coffees are excellent and its a great place to enjoy a relaxing evening..I also like their Baklawa, sandwiches and Brownies..""Best coffee in Pittsburgh, without a doubt. Believe the hype. I've been going here for years, and every visit is a pleasure.""Yes! Awesome soy cap, scone, and atmosphere. Nice place to hang out & read, and free WiFi with no login procedure.""Thought it's somewhat pointless to write a review for this place. I mean, every spro geeks i know of in town knows this is the best place to get a cup doppio or any espresso drink. The only reason I still decided to write this review is stupid yelp doesn't let me add a store to my list unless I have written a review for it. dah!""This place is where all my fine coffee addiction started with. Never did I have a cup of starbucks coffee after my first visit to Tazza D'ro. Not sure if it is a good thing, since now I have to do a lot of research on where to get a good cup of coffee before going to a new city no matter for business or for pleasure.""I love their signature """"bike love"""" for all the espresso drink w/ milk. It's fruity, mild, and fragrant. It's addictive! The only thing I have against it is that it has pretty strong caffeine in it, although it tastes super innocent. It's actually almost stronger then any spro blend I've tried."I also appreciate a lot  the community atmosphere and the effort to bring in community improvement of TD."Not a good place to study/work at on a weekend afternoon tho. It's too popular thus noisy.""""One of the best cups of coffee in pgh.  Great atmosphere for working, studying or a meeting.  Very neighborly feeling.""I would never have found this place if it wasn't for yelp.  It is somewhat hidden among lots of houses and residential buildings.  I ordered a latte and blueberry scone, both were great!  I wanted to order food but I was told that they do not serve food (even breakfast) until 11 a.m.  I would go back if i am in the area.""Some of the best coffee in Pittsburgh (and many argue that it is in fact -the- best). Really warm, rich blends, especially the espresso. The tea menu is extensive and has a lot of variety, so it's a great place for non-coffee-drinkers, too. It has a relaxed atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating (is there anything cosier than curling up in one of the window seats with a book/notebook on a rainy day?). I've done it all here-- from writing and filing an article when the newsroom was too loud to meeting a blind date. It's a good place to linger and savor. Its proximity to the park is a big advantage.""Just realized that no one mentioned about their chai latte yet. They make their chai from scratch. The best chai I have ever had outside of my indian co-worker's kitchen. The only thing is, since they premade a whole pot, there's no way you can get a cup of skim chai...""local, friendly businesses serving a great product DO still exist."Best coffee I had in Pittsburgh. Their Italian Cappuccino is pretty addictive."The coffee here is amazing (I love when the baristas take the effort to make patterns in the foam). The baristas were extremely friendly and the pastries looked delicious. While there are a number of tables, Enrico's was busy even on a Friday night...I would imagine that it would be hard to find a table during peak hours."one of the best espresso bars i've been to.+1 for great espresso.  i had a shot of ethiopian espresso.  fantastic!  grabbed a costa rican pour-over on my way out ... perhaps one of the best cups of coffee i've ever had.+1 for baristas who pay great attention to detail"+1 for great atmosphere.  the ceiling is tastefully ornate, and the decor is pleasing.  hearty wood furniture used throughout."+0 for having a location a bit far from downtown.a favorite for locals and not-so-locals alike."highly recommended!  i will return...""""The environment is just what you would hope for in a coffee shop: tastefully decorated with some local art in an old building with a cool ceiling and floor. A great place to enjoy a beverage, book, and music."I had an Italian Cappuccino. It was well balanced and I enjoyed every sip. On my way out I had a Costa Rican pour over that took me by surprise. It was incredibly smooth with a complex flavor. It rolled off my tongue without the thin taste of a poorly roasted bean. As the drink cooled the flavor profile changed but continued to please."I highly recommend this shop if you are looking for a place to spend a few hours and enjoy everything from speaking with competent baristas to the last sip of your drink. I will be returning.""""I tell everyone about this Highland Park gem my friend introduced me to. People who come here appreciate expertly steamed milk and delicious breakfast/lunch options. In this quaint shop gone are the days of the mass-produced lattes and microwaved sandwiches. Every time I visit Pittsburgh, I make sure this place is in my schedule somewhere. Love it."Pittsburgh's definitely got nothing on Seattle when it comes to a good brew but if you look hard enough you'll find a few diamonds in the rough. Tazza D'Oro is one of them. I wont say THE best simply because coffee is such an objective taste but you cannot deny the expertise and care Tazza D'Oro subscribes to. It brings them millions of miles above Starbucks and (gasp) Crazy Mocha."I found out about Tazza D'Oro while browsing the blog of an award winning, internationally recognized barista. He conveniently mapped out his favorite coffee houses around the US via Google Maps. I clicked on PA and zoomed it, not even expecting to see a marker. Surprisingly there was -- only one -- and it was for Tazza D'Oro.""Their baristas know how to make the perfect espresso. Once you've done that all of your other drinks fall right into place. They also do french pressed coffee which is a rare treat usually enjoyed at home and, at least in my case, not done nearly as well as it should be. Their pastries and baked goods come straight from one of the 'burgh's best bakeries -- Enrico's in the Strip District; what more could you ask for?""I have a longer article on Tazza D'Oro as well as another great coffee shop, Espresso a Mano on my website. http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2011/02/11/coffee-pittsburgh-part-2/"""I can remember the time when I used to strictly drink mocha frappuccinos from Starbuck's thinking that it was the be all end all to coffee in my younger teens. Don't we all miss those days of being so naive? "Admittedly, I never finish any coffee that I drink, not only because I'm apparently wasteful now that I think about it, but also because I'm a slow sipper and everything settles at the very end. Make no mistakes, I will finish any coffee drink from Tazza D'oro and at record speed. It is delicious to the very last drop and the best part is, they don't think that third degree burns go hand in hand with their coffee -- it's ready for drinking the moment you receive your order. Let's not forget about the food, which is also delicious. it's clear I have nothing bad to say about this establishment.""Some of the staff remembers your order to a tee and all of them are always very courteous. The prices are reasonable and the location is great, tucked away in Highland Park."""As if in answer to my prayer.I'm not basing this review on the quality of the coffee. I had Rooibos tea and a (delicious) apple galette. "I'm basing this on the fact that I love this style of coffee shop (could be in Seattle or Portland). And the fact that since coming to P'burgh for a few days for the first time, it's the first aggregation of non-grumpy people I've been around. Well, to be fair, all the partying college students on the South Side last night were not grumpy. Maybe it's that the folks sitting around me here at Tozza Doro are just chilling, quietly dong whatever they are doing, and not being overly grumpy or self absorbed. ""They don't apear to have more than coffee and pastries, but they do have free wireless.""There is not as much in this neighborhood as I thought there was going to be, but if you find yourself here, and you like non-corporate, home grown cafes, this is a great place to chill."""Outstanding lattes. Period. "The service can be *very* slow, but the latte is worth the wait. And, the staff does not seem to care to chat with customers, but they make darn good lattes so who cares.""Tucked in the beautiful Highland Park neighborhood among many historic houses and close to the handful Bryant street restaurants, Tazza D'oro is a fantastic place for coffee lovers like me. A nice short walk from Highland Park is a welcome plus. Get the latte, take a stroll down the street to explore the houses, and take a walk in the park. That is a beautiful and coffeeful sunny summer afternoon for you. ""They also have food, but I cannot speak for that. The interior is somewhat run down at places, but that gives it character.""""Finally, a great neighborhood coffee shop that just so happens to brew fantastic coffee. The espresso is incredible, which makes for an excellent cappuccino, and the food is pretty good, too. Croissants, muffins, and other baked goods top the breakfast list, while made-to-order paninis and delicious homemade soups round out the lunch menu.""The crowd at Enrico's is varied, which I really enjoy. My 65-year-old neighbor and his crew of retired friends pull up a chair every day at 3:00 pm next to business folks, college students, techies, and other folks who are looking for a good brew.""No frills, no extras; just nice people in a quaint coffee shop, brewing up warm goodness."""Hands down the best cappuccino you'll get in Pittsburgh. I have yet to be disappointed. Consistency in quality in a coffee joint is what I'm looking for! (Oh and alright those delectable treats they always have don't hurt either... Apple dumpling?!?!)"Great atmosphere, often crowded, not too expensive, tasty beverages. ""Both my husband and I had mochas- delicious!""""Wonderful! Lovely! Quaint! One of the most refreshing cafe's in pittsburgh! My visit was a 'surprise' from my boyfriend who knows how much I appreciate fine espresso. I was instantly enamored with the set-up inside and the pleasant nature of the individuals who greeted us behind the counter. The baked goods were absolutely fabulous and we literally would have bought one of everything if we hadn't come to our senses. I ordered a grande cafe mocha and it came with a wonderful rim of whipped cream (I believe the whipped cream was homemade as well.... simply to die for) and a subtle addition of foam art which just shows how considerate the baristas are of their craft. My boyfriend ordered the italian cappuccino and said it tasted just like the drinks he would get in Italy over his 2 week visit with family this past summer. Now if that isn't representative of a solid job in bringing a European Cafe to the States, then I don't know what is!""Best coffee, ultimate staff, neighborhood gem""I really was missing Voluto before its new ownership / management took over, on Penn Ave.  I Needed a new place to try with friends who live in Highland Park for an excellent cup of fancy Joe. I'm a steamed milk kind of gal.""Starbucks bless them when I am in a rush but i have to order a tripple just to get a hint of my fix, but the coffee here is the right strength to cover my caffeine withdrawals. Lovely atmosphere small but not tiny, outdoor seating if you want it. Their espresso shots are not served in steamed cups."Take note if you're a hardcore ezzzspresso shooter and you like it piping hot. I am sure if you asked they could probably warm the cup. The baristas are so friendly and laid back and funny. Also the staff members let me use the bathroom after closing one time perfect gentlemen :) A decent selection of yummy pastries to compliment your coffee awaits from apple turnovers to decadent brownies."I also like the crowd that comes here, there are younger people, older peopler and everyone inbetween (the 30 somethings and 40 somethings) my age group. It has a neighborhood feel but I can tell people come from surrounding areas, Tazza is a great example of merging the old and new in Pittsburgh while maintaining the character of its home borough."""BEST COFFEE IN PITTSBURGH!You might think there is better coffee elsewhere.  You're wrong!"I love this coffee shop, and there is a second location the Gates Building at CMU that I like to go to--their panini are to die for.""I love this place, and you will too!""""Everything I want in a bistro!  The sandwiches are delicious, the service is wonderful.  Love that pastry guy!  Ambiance is great!  The only thing is... it's a little crowded because everyone loves this place!"Really hard to find a good cup of coffee in the states... I'd say this is the best  cappuccino I've had since Italy.I just moved into a new place in highland park and realize this place was right next door. I'm a huge fan of coffee and have never been quite satisfied with the taste ever since my trip to Italy(where there coffee is to die for). This place makes me happy with coffee again. I've also had lunch here and bagels for breakfast both very delicious. This is my new place!I love Counter Culture coffee :-) The baristas are very friendly and very accommodating.Absolutely fantastic. One of my favorite places to hideaway and get some work done or just read a book."I adore this place! The light green walls are serene, the chairs and tables are comfortable, and I love their little brownies with three kinds of chocolate chips in them! The coffee is perfectly smooth and rich, which is the most important thing to get right. (I'm not into masking the taste of burnt espresso with a mocha!) If a place can provide me with a cup of coffee that doesn't taste like it will give me an ulcer, I'll be a fan for life. The only other Pittsburgh place where I've found coffee this delicious was at Commonplace Coffee in Squirrel Hill. I went to college near Chicago and come from California. I count Intelligentsia and Blue Bottle Coffee as some of my favorite places, so I mean it when I say the coffee here is wonderful. Try it out, you won't be let down.""I walked in to this business and immediately knew I could risk a latte without flavoring to cover up poor quality or technique, and I was absolutely correct. The espresso was a perfect balance of flavor with a smooth finish, the foam was stretched perfectly and expertly poured to form a heart in my mug. My accomplice's Americano was equally well made, not a note of sourness but plenty of body and flavor. I regret that I didn't notice the ""Manual"" bar menu before I ordered, I've been dying to try a pour-over coffee, and I know it would have been delicious. ""Pro-Tip: There is no sign for the unisex restroom, which is to the left of the service area, past the bulletin corkboard.""""Had a cup of Cappuccino. Tasted good, but not that impressive. Well, it's just a regular cappuccino. Five stars to the street view at a sunny winter afternoon.""best in pittsburgh, hands down!!!!"Saw this place listed on a blog--and had to come here. We had tea and cappuccino. It was delicious- but my favorite thing is the neighborhood and the outdoor seating. Great for a coffee dateWonderful place for both great coffee and a cool"Atmosphere for working with chill, usually good music and interesting crowd.  If I wrote anything more it would be over kill.  That's all you need to know.  Oh, except it's a good looking crowd and tell them to stay open later at least one night a week!""""Cute little shop! I take my daughter here after school sometimes for a green tea and a snack. Everything is delicious, we've never been dissatisfied. The staff is very friendly as well! My favorite coffee/tea place in Pittsburgh.""Now that's a nice latte. One of the better lattes I've had. I'd highly recommend it. I only got it to go, so I can't comment on much else. But I'd recommend it. Parking is a pain.""My favorite gym! The atmosphere is spa like, which is a nice place to be after work.  I just love all their classes... they have so many and at convenient times.  My favorites are the Body Pump classes. The staff is very friendly and helpful.""Club 1 is not just a gym - it's a support center for your goals in fitness and in life. Not only do they provide a whole range of classes at no extra charge with membership, but they go the extra mile with those who really work it. "" I find it impossible to have the stamina for everydaylife's marathons of apartment and job searches, bureaucratic runarounds, and even having a social life when I am significantly overweight (carrying an extra 40 pounds). I know that each time I lose the weight, I swear never again, but life interferes with my healthy routines, and stress, upheaval, desperation and disappointments kick in with cortisol and bellyfat. Suddenly, I am looking at myself, angry and miserable - a fat suit in a mirror, berating myself for letting my latest heart and soul effort put my heart at risk and my soul that much closer to G-d (but not in a good way). In this moment, I am grateful that Club 1 is there, that they take my insurance, that their staff are willing to match the effort I put in to help me get back on track. Just knowing, in that moment, that they are there, empowers me, gives me hope - the strength to overcome procrastination and fatigue to make that next right choice -just get there - even for 5 minutes. More the next time. Thanks everybody!""""I love this place. I been going here for years. I loved the BBQ sauce when it was used at the old Hot Licks in Shadyside and later The Motor Square Gardens. I was happy when I found out Buffalo Blues used the same recipes. The service is okay, parking is an issue, but it is worth it to me. Try the burger with BBQ sauce. YUM YUM""Went to wing night last night (06/10) and had the most kickass service at the bar. The wings were awesome, beer was good, and the staff was really helpful in finding seats for our inconveniently large 7-top. Good vibes, good prices, and seriously, awesome bartender.""I have a cat, so this review is cat-centric.""Great independently owned pet store.  They only carry more premium foods, so if you feed your cat Fancy Feast or Cat Chow, don't come here for that sort of thing.  Also only carry the more eco-friendly cat litters - no Tidy Cats here!  Friendly staff, and the prices are not much more than you would be paying at Petco or similar places.  Of course, you don't get the huge selection either, but this is my go to place for buying food, litter, and random toys.""It makes me feel good to be supporting a local establishment.  Try it - you might find that you like it too.""""Smiley's is wonderful... filled with things to keep our trio of cats well-fed, well-treated, and well-entertained. Certainly this is not a big box store, but, honestly, I wouldn't give my pets 99% of the food, treats, or toys that can be found in those stores, so, really, Smiley's offers me a better selection of what I actually want than any big box does. (They have a very good selection of toys for cats!)  And Smiley's takes bulk orders and has the food within a few days... saving us the trouble of schlepping out to the 'burbs.""Not really an update so much as a plea to the Yelp community. If you are needing pet supplies and live in the Point Breeze/Shadyside/Squirrel Hill/East Liberty area, please PLEASE consider stopping by and supporting this store. With the new PetSmart (or is it Petco?) open down the street where Borders used to be, this independently owned store is under a lot of pressure to survive. Given that the prices are not that different, please give this place a shot. I'm not super anti-chain stores, but I AM pro-independent stores (does it have to be a zero-sum game?).""I love Smiley's. It's that kind of amazing local establishment where Ginny (the owner) knows everyone's name, their pets name and the products you like to buy. You know the one....the only place around that carries that food/treat/toy your pampered pet likes, so you will travel near and far to find? For us, that pet is our cat, Nicholas, and that hard to find treat is the dehydrated chicken treats he loves. What I love is that but everything they have is a quality product. None of that good, better, best stuff like the box stores; they will only sell the best, healthiest products for your pet. Super friendly staff and fantastic products... I mean, what else can you ask for??""My wife and I have both been seeing Dr. Segal for over five years.  He's great, one of the best chiropractors I've seen over the years and I strongly recommend him to everybody we know.  I've had regular chiropractic care since my late teens, not just for injuries, but also maintenance.  Dr. Segal has been excellent about tailoring treatment and frequency to what is going on.  No sales pitch for extras, just a good assessment and focused manipulation.  From someone who puts a lot of stress on my neck and back through work and play, this is a great place to go.""I'm a medical professional who would have never gone to a chiropractor...until 2010. A Univ of Penn medical school graduate told me about Dr. Segal.  His down to earth personality and explanations excellent. Jackie his admin everything is wonderful. After 2 months of intense treatment I've had no issues, complete mobility and back to normal. He's not selling nutriceuticals, xrays, devices, etc. He's there for his patients, period. Great great guy.""Dr. Seagle is wonderful. My whole family goes to him. The amazing feeling of instant Relief that I get every time I hear that pop, is amazing. I have been to chiropractors all over the world. None of them to the success  of Dr. Seagle. I used to have chronic migraines daily. Would go a few times a week. After continual visits for years. I am happy to report I rarely get migraines and only need to visit every couple of month. This man knows what he is doing!"I had never gone to a chiropractor until I saw Dr. Segal. He explained everything from start to finish - a bedside manner that enables anyone to feel at ease. I am referring all of my coworkers and friends to this man."Essentially, as good as it gets. I don't plan on going anywhere else.""""My husband has been going to Dr. Segal for many years. In 2011, I finally broke down and went for chronic low back pain. Dr. Segal immediately diagnosed it as a hip problem and told me to see a suitable MD. Long story short: I had my hip replaced in 2013. Recently I started going to Dr. Segal again ... still having back problems (some kind of joint in my spine this time). The problem is much better after alignment. So ... we've had very good experiences with Shady Hill Chiropractic.""Going to a new mechanic to get your car repaired shouldn't rank up there with public speaking and first dates, but it usually does.  Well not if you go visit Tim at Walter's.  They guys at Walter's are friendly, trustworthy, and treat you with respect.""They are a small shop so call ahead if you need major service, but where else are you going find a mechanic who actually suggests way to save money on the repair""""The most important quality a mechanic can have is honesty. Meet Tim Walter. When I take my car to Walter's I know the service will be good, fast and won't take a chunk out of my last paycheck. Calling ahead is usually a good idea so they can fit you in...""Walter's is just a fantastic establishment.  Tim is a phenomenal mechanic, who is as honest as they come, charges amazingly low prices, and - Morten H. is not lying - will actually suggest ways to save you money.  The shop is small and usually pretty busy, but they will do their best to fit you in and get your car fixed up ASAP, and Tim always takes time to explain your car's problems to you.  He will even show you what's wrong inside the car, or tell you how to do something yourself if that's what would be more sensible.  I recommend Walter's to anyone who's in the market for a mechanic.""I cannot say enough good things about Walter's.  Tim, the head mechanic (Tim Walter, hence the name of the shop), is amazingly helpful and accommodating.  He repairs my car quickly every time I go in, and I never have to bring it back for further repairs.  He also fits me in right away (though it is a good idea to call ahead - they do get super busy because of their sheer awesomeness and small size).  And when I pick my car up, he'll explain what was wrong and how he fixed it in a completely unpatronizing way, then usually undercharge me.  I know, sounds too good to be true, but isn't.  I'll be moving for grad school soon, and I can honestly say I will miss Walter's.  I don't think I'll ever find a better shop/mechanic.  ""A quick word of warning: Tim's adorable, but completely ADD.  He'll fix your car well, and quickly, but he does get easily distracted sometimes.  Bear with it, he's totally worth it.""""My car wouldn't start so I started yelping the closest option to my apartment. I found Walter's and with such great reviews below I gave him a call. He drove over to my apartment and looked at my car hoping that it'd be something simple before we got it towed. After witnessing him take time out of his busy day to do this, I knew he was a good guy.""Unfortunately, it did need towed and he was afraid it'd take a week to fix due to his booked schedule. He called the next day to tell me that he looked at it, realized it was a simpler fix than he originally thought and had it done later that day.""I had a great experience and am sure everyone else will. Thanks Tim""""I just want to echo what everyone else has already said about this mechanic.  My brakes gave out and I came upon the glowing reviews for Walter's, so I gave them a call.  Not only did Tim fix my car quickly and inexpensively, he actually came to pick it up himself so that I wouldn't have to spend money on a tow truck!  He's also an extremely friendly, funny guy who puts you at ease immediately.  I'll be going back there without hesitation the next time I need anything done on my car.""Went to Walters after I had a ripoff repair store tell me my Volvo needed new roters.  Thank goodness I know what they are and that they had been replaced just 16 months ago.  Tim at Walters confirmed my belief and passed my inspections.  He was fast, funny, and smart.  I then sent my husband in with his ailing BMW and Tim did a fantastic service on it as well.   This is a real honest and thoghtful mechanic."I love Tim."I bought a shitty used car and it kept DYING when I would drive uphill, and I was new in town so I asked for some shop recommendations from people online and a bunch of people pointed me to Walters. He helped me isolate the problem to my EGR valve, and while it wasn't a cheap fix, I can't imagine I could've gotten the work done any cheaper. I've also had several other problems, and he's always trying to save me money and do things as inexpensively as possible.""I wouldn't say my shitmobile runs like a dream or anything, but it's definitely in much better shape than when I started.""And I usually don't have to wait too long for repairs. Typically I can drop it off in the morning (after making an appointment a few days in advance) and pick it up later that day. Though, they do seem pretty busy so I try not to expect them to get it done too quickly.""And I have to say, I really don't care if my mechanic is a friendly, personable guy because I'm just paying him to fix my car and as long as he does that right I'm happy. But Tim is one of the nicest guys I've ever met, and I really enjoy talking to him.""""Growing up, my dad always fixed my car.  Now that he lives two states away, I don't have that luxury anymore.  Luckily, Tim at Walter's Automotive is a great substitute.  Honest, friendly, and helpful--I'd recommend him to anyone in Pittsburgh."Excellent and trustworthy mechanic.Walter's was SO helpful  when our daughter's car was misdiagnosed by another garage. He talked us through the options over the phone (we're 300 miles away) and helped us find a solution. Two thumbs up!"Wonderful experience. I had a flat tire, and he checked it inside and out, tested it overnight, and put it back on my car. When I went to pay, he said it was nothing. He even gave me helpful advice on some other aspects of my car I was neglecting. During a bad week, this was a much-needed act of generosity.""Highly recommend.""""What can I say about Tim that hasn't already been said? Although I didn't end up getting my car serviced at Walter's Automotive, Tim gave me a lot of helpful advice and was very personable. You can tell he genuinely cares about his customers and their concerns.""I'll definitely be going to him if there's anything that I need to get fixed in the near future.""""Tim is fantastic with German cars, including my 2003 3-series BMW, which was out the door for 400 - broken axle, oil change, tire rotation and one other thing. Labor prices are reasonable, it's just hard as hell to get an appointment. If he weren't so damn nice (like doing all sorts of free things for people) he could probably have himself a bigger, better garage and more people working for him."Great experience. Honest and friendly!!"If I could give Walter's automotive more than 5 stars, I would.""I called Tim around 8am because my brakes were making an awful sound (I know nothing about cars).  He said it usually takes a few weeks to get an appointment, but if I wanted to drive it over he would take it for a ride with me to diagnose the problem.""I drove it over, he took one look at my car and found the problem.  He didn't have room for me right then, but I dropped it off 2 days later in the morning and I had it back before the end of the day.  ""Before I left, he noticed all the expired parking passes covering my back window and offered to take them off for me.  Great customer service; I will definitely be back with any future car issues.""""I went here a couple weeks ago to get new tires on my car. I couldn't agree more with the other reviewers. Walter's was originally supposed to call me with an estimated cost, and when I hadn't heard, I called and spoke with Walter directly. 15 minutes later, he had an estimate for me. When I couldn't decide on the tire I wanted, he had three different types waiting for me when I came in for my appointment & went through the pros and cons of each! Just great service!""I also found the price reasonable & the service was quick.""""Scenario: Get into my car at 3:30 and head to campus for a meeting. All of a sudden, the tire warning signal lights up even though I don't remember running over anything. I get out of the car to carefully inspect my tires and they feel/look completely OK. But after owning a BMW for 3 years and having constant wheel alignment/tire issues (ie. when a tire warning signal lights up, it usually means my tire's about to blow out!!), I freaked out and frantically drove my Infiniti to the first 3 auto shops on Baum Blvd. I waited at the first stop for 5-10 minutes and the guy did not get off the phone. I got back into the car and drove it over to Pep Boy's where a mechanic was outside smoking. He says I need to go through their service desk (inside their huge store) and deal with them first. I'm thinking, ""ugh. no time. I have class in 40 minutes and I'm already late to my meeting."" I drive past the 3rd shop and I don't even see anyone sitting at the reception desk and figure it's going to take forever to get what I'm asking for.""Then, I remembered the really positive experience I had with Walter's. I decided to drive to the end of Baum Blvd. to find his place and boy, am I glad I did. As soon as I got there, the service coordinator told me to pull my car around front so that their mechanic could take a look at my tires. He stopped what he was doing to do this and told me I could just stay in my car. Then, he reassured me that my tires were OK and he proceeded to inflate them, explaining to me why the signals might have come on.""Free of charge, in and out within 5 minutes, and helpful/reassuring. I love this about Walter's Automative. They're not out just to make money. They genuinely just want to help. Highly reccommend!!""""As numerous people have pointed out, Walter's is indeed a great repair shop.  Tim (Walter is his last name) and the rest of his staff are friendly, honest, professional, and reliable.  I highly recommend this shop for repairs, maintenance, and check ups.  ""However, they are victims of their own awesomeness.  The waits here can be long--2 weeks or more--due to how busy they are and they only have one bay.  If you do have a pressing safety concern though, Tim is always willing to take your car for a spin or do a quick diagnosis to let you know if something needs to be taken care of.""""Great place. I take my car there for everything. Inexpensive, friendly, and knowledgeable. They've fixed my tire, taped a broken hose temporarily, and done other things for no charge several times. I'd definitely recommend them.""Best car repair spot in town.  Tim is honest, hard-working, and knows his sh*t.  I've been in burgh for 3 years now.  I was driving a 2000 Nissan Maxima and it had 170K miles on it.  Now, I loved that car and whenever something went wrong I brought it in to Walter's.  Last time I brought it in I asked him if I should put more money into the car- the alternator was out and a new battery was needed.  The car would not start.  He told me it is a good time to get a new car because he wan't sure how much more this car could take.  He even gave me a couple of numbers of guys who buy cars ""as is.""  I called these guys and sold this beater maxima for $1000 as is!  ""Now, I drive a 2011 Malibu and I'm a happy girl.  Thank you Tim- I appreciate you looking out!  Other car repair shops would have fixed my car charged me out the azz only for my car to break down again.  Tim really does have your best interest."""Walter's garage is awesome!  I was in real trouble with my car and needed immediate repairs and he managed to fit me into his busy schedule and charged a fair price for the work.  He was kind and honest--what more could you ask for from a mechanic?  :)I have a general rule of thumb when picking out an auto repair shop:"The """"office"""" must be very messy and grease and dirt must be everywhere.  ""In my opinion, if an auto shop has the time and money to keep a squeaky clean appearance, they're wasting some of your money you pay for service.  Walter's Automotive fits the bill with their """"office"""" being a small cluttered desk in the service bay.  Their """"lobby"""" is the doorway that you stand in just outside the """"office.""""  I couldn't be happier with my first impressions--to me, minimal overhead means maximum service and value.""Sure enough everyone at Walter's is very nice and helpful.  Apparently, everyone else in Pittsburgh knows this since I have to schedule an appointment 10 days in advance just to get my car inspected.  So please, even though Walter's is awesome, don't come here--I want this place to myself."""I thought I need an alignment and turns out all I needed was a tire balance. I stopped by he had me go with him and we drove around the block. I didn't cost me a thing because the tire balance was under warranty. Really  nice guy."Mr. Walter is an honest, friendly guy. He helped me out a lot with my VERY old car. Always took the time to explain what was going on. The services he did to the car were not always as quick as some would hope, but I never felt cheated or ignored or talked down to, he always did a great job.""When that old (VERY old) car finally, truly died (became unfixable) and needed to be scrapped, he even volunteered a partial refund to me because he said he wished that his most recent work on it could have been enjoyed by me for longer, so that I could have gotten my money's worth. He truly is a super guy to work on your car.""""I had to get a new mechanic since I recently moved here. That worried me, a lot, as I own a VW. Thankfully I found all these reviews on Yelp about Walters and decided to give it a shot. "Rules about Walters: Plan at least two weeks ahead for an appointment. It is worth it. "From there you don't have to worry about anything. On my particular car I always have to fix the suspension, and I ended up needing the same repair from last year. Last year I spent $1,300 from my very reasonable and trustworthy mechanic I had been using for years at home. This year Walters quoted me just under $700. I was pretty blown away by that considering the other place I go to is just as down to earth as Walter's."Walters took the time to put my tennis racquets in my trunk and remove my aftermarket stereo so they wouldn't be seen. He explained everything to me thoroughly and was really friendly when I came to pick up my car. "I know a lot about cars and mechanics since I've worked at a dealership and the honesty of Walters still amazes me. I will take my car here every time I need to get something done, even if I get a newer car with a warranty from a dealership.""""There are at least 2 auto repair shops where I could drop my car and walk home or to school in less than 10 minutes.  I have to drive to Walter's, take the bus back home and catch it back  to get my car.  It's about a 15 minute ride each way."I would walk there on my hands.  They are that awesome."Tim is not only great at what he does, he is cool as hell!  He was patient with me and my (over 230,000 miles) car that took a freaking month to pass the emissions inspection. Turns out the mass flow sensor wires were dirty- anywhere else and I would have already replaced 2 O2 sensors and I would still be going through emissions crap.""I am really happy to have found someone to take care of my car :-D  Thanks Tim!!!""""I like Tim Walter so much, I almost wish my car would break down so I would have an excuse to see him. ""He is super honest, explains everything, gets the cheapest appropriate parts he can, and isn't the least bit condescending. Picture the kindest surgeon you can; Tim Walter is the same, just for cars instead. ""Also, the man has a great memory. He *still* makes fun of me for that Coke can I had strapped to my muffler 7 years ago."""For the last 5 years that I have been living in Pittsburgh I have been coming to Walter's...its always been a bit of trick planning to take my car in for maintenance as they are very busy because they are indeed great mechanics and generally awesome and friendly people. You absolutely do need to call a few weeks ahead and be patient. Quality service takes some time. "Now that I am moving to the opposite side of the country, I took my car in one last time to get everything checked out, fixed, swapped out etc. My car was in the shop for 3 days and I waited patiently knowing that I can trust Tim and Arlene in the same way I can trust my parents to get something important done. They aren't there to screw you over. I know this because I had, on my first occasion taking my car there, gotten a second opinion on somethings and everything aligned between the two sources so they earned my trust! ""They took care of me and my car really well. Arlene kept me up to date on what was going on and Tim took the time to explain what the parts were, what they did and how much things were going to cost. He even sat with me after closing hours researching the oxygen sensor and tires I needed online and quoting me the best price. He listed out everything I needed to have done and told me which was most important for a cross country drive and what could wait. That is service and care!! ""If you need a great mechanic, like you need a good doctor, be patient, be inquisitive and do a little bit of planning. Your car will get serviced, your wallet will be in good shape and you might learn a bit about the car you drive. I only hope to find as good of a business in Seattle as I did here in Pittsburgh. ""Thanks for everything!""""Hands down a great experience! I called yesterday as the driver headlight on my car was out and asked if I needed to make an appointment. The woman on the phone said to just stop right by during their hours. I went by this morning and their (small) lot was full so I just sat in my car while I believe who was Tim was finished chatting with another guy. I continued to sat in my car for a couple of minutes while Tim quickly inspected my headlight. Unfortunately he did not have any replacement bulbs but ordered them right on the spot while I was there and told me to come back any time in the afternoon. Fast forward a few hours later. I  just popped by and after popping my hood and going into their office to pay, my headlight was replaced! Friendly, honest, fair and quick service. No BS. Highly recommend Walter's Automotive.""I found this mechanic based on the excellent Yelp reviews and I was not disappointed.  I came to Walter's because my radiator was leaking coolant and Walter tried to save me money by doing a patch job on the leak which he was only going to charge me $20.  Unfortunately it didn't work and I still had to go through with the replacement, but I appreciated the time he took to give a cheaper alternative a try.  And Tim Walter is a friendly guy who will take the time to discuss the problem with you and give you a fair deal.  This place gets busy so you will likely have to call a week in advance and leave your car at least overnight, but it's close to bus stops.  There is no waiting area and I don't think they do any quick jobs that you can stay and wait for.""I was having an issue with the emissions light in my car. I spoke with Arlene, who gave me a rundown of what I could expect while my car was in the shop. She then told me that even though they were very busy, I could stop by before my appointment so that Tim could check things out and make sure my car was safe to drive. Tim poked around, figured out it was the gas cap, and sent me on my way without charging. A good mechanic is worth their weight in gold and I will not only return to this garage but refer others as well."A trust worthy mechanic is very rare these days...I split time between Seattle (work) and The Burgh (Family) so when my car began to lose power on acceleration I searched for a local repair shop on yelp... Based on the numerous positive reviews I made an appointment at Walters on Baum Blvd."My appointment was made for two weeks in advance but Tim had me bring my car in and we took it for a test drive. Tim determined that it was the Cat converter and recommended that I not drive the vehicle very much as to not cause further damage. Tim said that he and one of his mechanics were going to work extra hours that weekend to get caught up and that he would try to get to my vehicle. So I dropped my car off on Wed night, on Thursday Tim called with an estimate that was 150.00 to 200.00 less than what others had quoted. "I expected my car to be worked on over the weekend however at the end of Thursday Tim called and told me that my car was ready and running great! Wow! I was surprised and grateful. When I picked up my car on Friday the cost for repairs was 15.00 less than my original quote due to a gasket that was included with the part and not ordered separate. I figure that many shops would have just kept the refund from the extra part and would have charged me for the quoted price but not Tim at Walter's."I can't say enough about the excellent service I received from Walter's..."""I cannot sing Tim Walter's praises loud enough."I have taken my car to him for about 5 years, and I always leave with a new experience attesting to his awesomeness. If you think you might have something wrong with your car that you're not sure what it is, you can just stop by, and he'll usually take a break from what he's working on to get in your car with you and drive for a little bit and then give you his opinion. Then, when he diagnoses your car, he'll explain it to you like you're not an idiot, and he'll make sure you understand what's going on. He's incredibly honest and cares about his customers. For instance, once I had a tire that needed to be replaced but he didn't have it in stock. He told me how much it would cost to have the tire ordered and how long it would take to come in, then he called another shop to see if they had it and asked how much they were charging for it, and he sent me there because it would be cheaper and faster for me than having him order it. The price difference was like ten bucks, so I had him do it because it wasn't an emergency and I'd rather give him my business. He's awesome.""""Mr. Walter is great. Reasonable prices, he's honest and tells you like it is. As a first-time car owner, he's helped me out numerous times and been very kind and generous in the face of my total ignorance!""What excellent service!  I couldn't be happier.  We have taken our car to Walter's for just about everything.  I have never felt so comfortable taking our care to an auto shop.  They are seriously the best in town, not to mention extremely helpful!  Happy to give them all of our car business, they are life-savers!""I heard about Walter's by the great reviews here on yelp. They did not steer me wrong. I went to the shop and asked for an appointment for leaking oil, but the secretary said they didn't have one for a couple weeks. Walter was doing work and asked me a couple questions, then asked if I could bring it in the next morning. The next morning! I did, and Walter and his employee lifted and took a look under my truck. Literally in seconds they found that it was simply a botched oil change, tightened the cap, and brought my truck down. He even topped off my oil, I believe. All this, and he said ""no charge on that"" as I went to pull out my wallet. I was in shock. ""As a side note, Walter and his staff are also very approachable. While his employee worked on my truck Walter, a fellow mechanic (?), and I talked about various things.""I will recommend Walter's to my brother who lives here in Pittsburgh, and will go to Walter's with any car trouble I have while I am here for school. I recommend Walter's in the highest degree."""Walters is the best!! I came in from Charlotte with my Son and picked up my Mother's car to drive back home. It was only going to be a one time fix. They treated me like I was special. They looked at the car and did what needed to be done to make the long ride back safely . The money that they billed me was incredibly reasonable and before we left I  had to go back to them after I discovered I had a blown fuse for the power outlet - they fixed this for no charge!!!! "I will always recommend Walter's Automotive to anyone I know who lives in Pittsburgh and needs any type of car work to be done.""""I had to give Walter's 5 stars, if there was a way to say it was exceptional, I would do that.""I found Walter's through yelp and was not sure how a auto repair shop had all 5-star reviews. This is totally unheard of. And now having gone there for a repair and inspection, I can just say, BEST MECHANIC IN TOWN. Other people have sung praises for Walter's already, so I won't get into that. My recommendation: If you are looking for an amazing, trustworthy, competent and humble mechanic, dial Walter's number. You will not be disappointed.""""This place has not only done my regular maintenance perfectly, but Tim has also dropped everything to help me in a pinch. Little things like changing my headlight for free when Pep Boys and Monro wanted me to wait 2 hours and charge me $20+ and helping me fill my coolant when I was in a panic. This place is just absolutely outstanding, I can't sing it enough praises.""I have an older car and so sometimes things go wonky. One night I had to drop it off because it was barely running and I had no idea why. This was the first time I went to Walter's, turns out that it was only an oil changing problem. Car places usually screw me over because I know nothing about cars, but Walters did not. They are really great and fix the car for your needs. Yesterday I returned for inspection and once again he treated me fairly and only mentioned things that I already knew needed work. I would recommend this place to anyone with an older car and wants an honest car repair man. Walter's will definitely be getting my business in the future!""Went to Walt's Auto for an inspection after seeing all of these great reviews on Yelp, and was so happy I did. I will be taking my car and my husband's truck here from now on. The service here cannot be beat!""As the Survivor song says ""THE SEARCH IS OVER""! After years of being taken advantage of by countless mechanics who care nothing about you or their workmanship, in Tim I have finally found a true gentleman who is a master at his craft. My situation was complicated and he accommodated me at every turn. Not only did he care about the cost, he twice came in on his day off to service my vehicle. I could sing his praises for an hour. I am a young widow, mother of three and know little of automotive repair. I live 90 minutes away. I will  EAGERLY return as needed without the fear that has accompanied me so many times before. Walt's Automotive is a dream come true.""Recently had some problems with my battery and took to yelp to find a nearby/reputable mechanic.  After reading all the great reviews on Walter's Automative, I made an appointment as recommended and brought my car in.""Long story short, minus all the technical details, Walter was very helpful and informative in helping me resolve the problem.  He was very open to listening to me describe the problem and was patient and quick to look into the issue and provide his expert advice. ""Customer service was great as well!  It was really easy to call and schedule an appointment, and when I arrived the minimal office space looked pretty organized, given that it's inside an auto shop.  All the keys looked organized and labeled.  The appointment book looked clear and kept up.  I can really appreciate when a business is well run.""I would definitely recommend giving this business a try!"""Honest. Reliable. Trust Worthy."Tim goes above and beyond with his service. He came to my house 3x one day to check everything he could before I ended up towing it to the garage. I will definitely go back!""""Walter's is the best and most honest mechanic I've ever worked with. They are super busy because they are so great, so they have no need to do unnecessary repairs. Can't speak highly enough of quality of their work and integrity!""I will never go anywhere else. Never had a shop tell me what I didn't need.  Treated my mother the same way.  Women if you looking for a place where you don't get ripped off, this is your place.  He is always busy, so he does not have time to add stuff on and just working with he is more worried about doing a good job.  I highly recommend this shop."I was cautiously optimistic about Walter's after seeing the great reviews. I wasn't disappointed at all! The staff at Walter's was very friendly and helpful in scheduling me an appointment and worked with me throughout the entire car repair process.The best thing about the entire experience was the price and the flexibility at Walter's. The staff allowed me to pick my car up after hours (I have a work schedule that did not allow for me to get my car during business hours). They also gave a very reasonable price for the work that was done. "The building may look small, but this is the best car repair place I've been to. Very impressed with the service and the staff."""After reading all of the great reviews I thought I would try them for my car's annual inspection. All I can say is I wish I had found out about them decades ago."I arrived on time, and he was ready for me -- no waiting. I told him I only have one car, and would have to wait in the area, so he said he would get to work on it ASAP. Sure enough, about 1.5 hours later it was done.""Even better, he told me nothing was wrong with it, so it would only cost me the price of the inspection. My car is only 6 years old, yet every other year wherever I took it there was a whole list of things which needed to be done, which ended up costing anywhere from $400-$600. Now I see how ripped off I was. "It's a priceless experience to leave an automotive shop and feel like you weren't cheated."In the future, whenever anything needs to be done to my car, the one and only call I will make will be to Walter's Automotive."""I can only agree with previous reviews in that the service is1) Good2) Affordable (the don't overcharge you)"3) Flexible, e.g., you can pick up the car late.""The personnel is polite and knowledgeable.""""Good honest business. They did not nickel and dime me and have quickly gained my loyalty and respect. They had the decency to recommend that I not get my inefficient catalytic converter replaced.  Bit of a wait to get the car in, but it was well worth it.""I just went to Tim as my check engine light came on on my recently purchased 2005 Toyota Corolla. Tim took a look at the code and told me what the problem was. Reset it for me and told me to call him if it comes on again, all free of charge in just 5 minutes. That is why I like Tim and will recommend him over anyone else, especially for old cars, the guy is very honest and will only recommend what is best for your car and your situation. Not making you spend money when you don't need to.""Even though I work nearby, there are several auto repair shops in the area so what drew me to Walter's was the fantastic reviews on Yelp, and I agree, and am a very satisfied customer.  They were able to squeeze me in for my past-due yearly inspection after my dealership was unable to keep my scheduled appointment last Saturday due to a power outage.  I dropped the car off before work and was able to pick it up easily.  They were attentive, friendly, and fair-priced - I plan on using them again not only for my yearly inspection but for my regular car maintenance.""My car had the SRS (supplemental restraint system, I think) light go on, which means either airbag or seatbelt issues.  Brought it into Walter, who mentioned that for my year car, there's usually a warranty covering this part, and I'd be better off at the dealer.  But I had been told by a dealer in the North Hills (in retrospect, incorrectly) that it wouldn't be covered, so I left it with Walter.""He diagnosed the problem as the seat belt buckle, called Shadyside Honda with my car's VIN, and Shadyside confirmed that the part *was* under warranty.  Walter then called me and suggested I take it there.  And he refused to charge me anything, even after two offers to pay.""So, in terms of honesty and willingness to really go beyond what a customer would expect, Walter's automotive gets top ratings!""""I used this shop in order to perform my annual inspection. They were extremely flexible with me being from out of state and my busy schedule. I was a bit apprehensive having an older car, but it passed without any issues. They're professional yet very approachable and reasonable prices. Fully recommend!"Leaving another review because Walter's has basically become the only car place I will go to. "Recently had my car in for an inspection. As always, the mechanics did great work and offered a very reasonable price for the services provided. "That's not why I'm leaving another review. "While I was there, a ring that has sentimental value to me fell out of my pocket. I didn't notice until later, and I had been to several places. I called each place and gave a description of the ring. But I figured that it was probably lost forever or had been stolen."Today (a day after I called) the mechanic at Walter's called me back and told me that he'd found the ring. "Not only did the staff there humor me and look for something that I figured lost forever, but they found it and returned it!""Thanks so much for being not just great mechanics, but great human beings too, Walter's staff!"""Shhhhh don't tell anybody!"Anything my car needs I go here. No matter what, Tim has a fair price and gets the job done. I never feel like he is trying to sell me anything extra. He just gets the job done and sends me on my way normally with in the day. This is a place you can trust and if he has an opening he will take you.""Great service, friendly people. I have been taking my car to Walter's for over two years now. ""Four months back, I got my wheel bearing and hub changed in my 97 Accord. But when the noise came back recently, Tim replaced the hub without costing much.""Honest would be the right word to describe the people at Walter's automotive.""""This man is the real deal, a great mechanic, funny guy, and honest businessman. I was fearing the worst for my car after pep boys gave me a very high price to fix my cooling fan and miscommunicated vital info about the repair, prompting my earlier negative review. It took awhile to complete the repair as Tim told me two other cooling fans they tried to put in were also faulty. They finally got a third one in that worked, and charged me only for the parts and labor to put that fan in, which ended up being hundreds less than Pep Boys. Plenty of places could have tacked on a lot of extra labor costs for changing out those failed fans. I was blown away by the good experience I had, even if it took awhile and a couple fans to get right. Tim has won a loyal customer with that kind of service.""The staff at Walter's treated me like an old friend even though this was my first time there. Everyone was so nice, the prices are unbelievable & I will definitely bring my car here for any services it needs!"Consistently awesome. Highly recommended. They always get my car in quickly. Their estimates are spot on. Very friendly.Probably unnecessary for me to add another 5 star review to this page... But I just can't help it."Called in because I noticed a strange problem with my car that was only perceptible after driving it around for a while. They told me to bring the car in for a road test the next day. When I went in, I mentioned that the car was still under warranty but the dealership wanted to charge me $150 for a """"diagnostic"""" before they could determine whether or not (a) there was actually a problem and (b) it was covered by my warranty. After driving around with me for about 20 minutes, Tim determined that there was definitely something strange going on... and then told me to take it back to the dealership and tell them that I had driven the car with a local mechanic and that there was clearly something wrong that should be covered by my warranty. ""How much was I charged for this? Not. One. Dime. Such a pleasure to receive great service while also being treated with kindness and respect. Would recommend this place to anybody in a heartbeat.""""Something I look for in car repair shops is accurate diagnosis, and I was not disappointed when I went to Walter's.  My car was screeching incessantly when I drove and turned.  It was so loud that I was worried that something was very wrong so I decided to get it checked out.  Walter took a look at my car and found that the problem was not serious, and he fixed the source of the noise with a screwdriver.  I drove away in minutes.  It was a good experience, and I would go back for other services."Walters automotive has never disappointed me. I was quoted almost double what Walters charged me for replacement brakes and rotors. I'm so thankful that I held out to go to Walters and get the fair price."Had my emissions inspection done here today. Tim is awesome. He has a sense of humor, is personable, and professional. I don't know much about mechanics, and when I asked him some questions, he explained it to me in laymen's terms without patronizing. He gave me advice on how I could make things go faster next year on their part. It was great. ""I was a little nervous about seeing a new mechanic for my car because I'm a young woman and we can be discriminated against in the mechanical world. But my friend recommended Walter's and I am so glad. Fast, efficient service.""""Had my front brakes replaced on my 2000 4Runner (rotors had gotten warped).  Also got an oil change.  Tim was awesome, had great stories and a funny guy.  Really great service here - definitely the place to go to.""I had my car inspected 2 weeks ago and it was a pleasure to deal with Walter's. They called me when they told me they would, and there were no surprises. It is so rare these days that you discover  a business so honest and so diligent. I would recommend Walter's to everybody;  however,  I'm worried I won't get an appt next year!""It's hard enough finding a good mechanic period. But to find one that's friendly and reasonably priced is unheard of. I've been loyal to Tim for the last 4 years and he's never let me down. If there's one complaint it's that things can sometimes take a little longer than expected, but this is a minuscule ""con"" in an ocean of ""pros."" At one time, I needed a new flex pipe put on my exhaust, Tim recommended that I go to a neighboring shop to get the exhaust work done because ""it would be too expensive if I did it."" This was something I've never encountered. A mechanic recommending another place to do business??? Do yourself a favor and give this place your business. Your car might be out of commission for a few days, but the comfort of knowing you're not being swindled is absolutely worth it.""Not that these guys need another 5 star review, but here I am.  Super nice folks. They are accommodating, knowledgeable, affordable, and fast.  I'm new to the area and went here based solely on yelp reviews. I hate dealing with mechanics but Walters was refreshingly painless."Recently took our car to Walter's for a state inspection. Could not be more pleased with the service provided by Tim and his staff. Time went above and beyond to make sure that we were taken care of. I will be going back to Walter's for all of my auto mechanic needs."Named for Pittsburgh greats, Gene Kelly and Billy Strayhorn, this historic theater is a real gem.  Originally the Regent, built in 1914, the building was renovated in 2000 as a performing arts center for theater, dance, music and film.  I have been to several fundraisers hosted by the Kelly Strayhorn, and they have always been first rate.  Also, I recently attended the Kelly Strayhorn's own fundraiser, Full Bloom, which was lots of fun.  As a venue, this place is definitely worth your attention, and the staff seems to bend over backward to make sure events go off without a hitch.""Whether it's an emergency or not, these guys make your problem a priority.  I called City Locksmith first, who said they would call me back in 5 minutes when they sent a technician.  I waited 30; called Ace Lock and someone was here in 10 minutes, just as City Locksmith was calling me to tell me they were finally going to send someone.  ""CALL ACE FIRST!!!!  :-D""""These guys are great. Fast, accurate, and very fair. I wouldn't go anywhere else."I already had a transponder key for my truck but needed the key cut so I could use it. They did it right then and didn't charge me anything."Extremely satisfied with the service that was provided by Ace Lock.  Their technician showed up on time, and got to work right away.  It is refreshing to see a craftsman who is proud of his work, and wants to get the job done quickly.""Exceeded expectations.  I needed some help with four lock sets, at 10 AM I called Ace (based on Yelp! reviews) and a very pleasant woman told they'd be there the same afternoon.  Sounded good.""What was even better?  They showed up less than an hour later!  Since when do service technicians show up several hours early?  Mike took care of the job quickly, efficiently and at a very reasonable price.""""Great guys there. Brought in a broken lock that it turned out they couldn't do much with but they spent well over an hour helping me and providing guidance on a replacement which they didn't even have to sell me (not lack of inventory, just different category - was more of a Home Depot product) Extremely professional, personable, and helpful staff. Will always come back with any locksmithing needs!""I love these guys.  I have been renting off of them for 4 years now and now am moving to another building.  they always fix the stuff i ask them to and although the buildings arent beautiful they work and are worth the  price.  they stay out of my business and you dont hear from them unless  you call them, which i love.  I will prolly stay with them until i buy a house in the next couple years."Great place. Easily the best in the city. Open on Saturday from 10am till sold out and there will usually be a line out the door.  "They will also take orders for things during the week but in whole sizes only (not slices, etc). They sell fresh eggs from their farm and supplies for making fresh mozzarella, etc.""Cooking classes are available and i have taken a couple, one with my daughter at the farm and it was worth every penny.""Highly rated.""""We watched the line start forming for Food Glorious Food around 9:30am while eating brunch next door.  They open their doors at 10am, so this was a good indication of what great things were inside.""Apparently they stay open until they are sold out.  By 11:30 when we finally got inside, there was still plenty of delicious things left!"My husband and I split a slice of key lime pie (one of his all time favorites.)  And he said he hadn't one so good since Miami.  "Our friends, who had been many times before, bought a ricotta pie and a multi-layered  nut/chocolate cake - also both divine.""I can't wait to go back!"""Marvelous! Saturday morning Secret Bakery? What?"Sure it's like waiting in line for Pink Floyd concert tickets, but then you get to eat the tickets. And they're delicious.""Can't stop thinking about that Jewish Pizza..."""Plays well with a Tazza latte around the corner! The quiche was divine and the the biscuits were what I imagine my mom would have made had she actually made biscuits. Two words: YUM-OH! Cannot wait to return to the Steel City so I can partake in some of the desserts."I have not had a bad thing from this place, ever.  I am hesitant to tell more people about this place, because I will stand in line longer on Saturday.  One weekend, I advance-ordered a chocolate/vanilla butter cream cake.  The ordering process was a bit drawin-out, but I was rewarded for my patience with the most amazing cake I have ever tasted.  I took the cake to a party, and the cake was the hit the talk of the party.  I will have to take 2 cakes to the next party.  Everyone stated that it was the best cake they had ever had.  My daughter craves that cake on Tuesday, and alas, I cannot scratch that itch till Saturday, when those magic doors open for a few hours to allow us into enjoy the sweet and savory heaven that Food Glorous Food offers.""This place has probably some of the best pastries I've ever encountered.  The treats are consistently great to amazing to even mouth watering.  The bakery is this quaint little place that is really cute with nice baking decorations and everything.  The staff is really friendly and always helpful with making the hard selection.  The cupcakes are these cream-stuffed pieces of heaven, and their signature sandwiches are out of this world.  Everything else leaves nothing to be desired, and keeps me coming back as frequently as I can find someone to accompany me.""I am at Food Glorious Food every weekend. I always try to sample something new every time I go, and everything I've had has been wonderful.""The cupcakes are so buttery and the fillings and frosting so creamy (and sweet, but not over the top sweet). The fruit tarts are also excellent-- my favorite is just topped with a very generous amount of cream and and assorted fruit (berries, kiwi, mandarin orange, etc). Ahh, soooo good."I haven't tried the focaccia (yet) but they look incredible. And I ALWAYS get a biscuit. Every time."They recently expanded their hours, and are now open Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. And they will take orders by phone. So if there is something you want that is a popular item, you can call and they will hold it for you until you get there! ""The line can be long but the staff is very efficient-- I've never had to wait longer than 15 minutes. I can't say enough wonderful things about this place!""""Went for the first time yesterday and will definitely go again and again!  Bought a huge assortment to share for dessert last night with some friends,  Amazing bread pudding- dreamt about it all night last night then woke up and ate the rest of it! The Jewish pizza was amazing, beat choc chip cookies ever, great Madeline's, great white lily cake, fantastic plum tart, to-die-for German choc cake and a really good sugar free cake with berries ( you'd never guess it was sugar free)The only thing that I thought was ""meh"" was the macaroons- tried blood orange and pistachio- have had much better right here in Pittsburgh from the French bakery in Millvale. I consider myself and expert in macaroons, and these were a little over cooked. Anyway, I declare this the best bakery I have ever gone to in Pittsburgh. Not cheap, but you really get what you pay for in this case.""Some of the best desserts you'll ever taste can be found here, and you can feel like you've discovered a city secret in the process. This is because the shop opens only Saturdays at 10 am, and you will usually spot a line forming at 9:30. They stay open until they sell out, which is usually around noon. It's like a magical place that opens for a brief period of time, then disappears as fast as it appeared. ""Anyways, as for the desserts, they feature at wide selection of tarts, cakes, and other types of pastries. All of them look mouth-watering delicious. One of the cakes won some sort of award...I had this and a few other kinds as well, and they were all phenomenal. They used an addictive whipped cream type of """"frosting"""" for their cakes, and all of this deliciousness can be had at completely reasonable prices.""I've always wondered why they only open Saturday morning though, and what they do during the week. Even if you're not in the area, it's worth arriving at 9:30 to experience the novelty and cool experience of this strange, tiny, and wonderful dessert shoppe!""""Very good dessert - had the lemon tarte. Even better Ham & Cheese sandwiches. Didn't try their biscuits, but will definitely be back next weekend :D""Bring cash! $10 minimum for credit/debit cards.""""The first time I came here, I waited in line for 20 minutes.  When it was my turn, I realized I left my wallet in the car.  It hurt so bad, I didn't come back for a year."I can walk to this place from my house- which is dangerous because those biscuits are just OH SO DREAMY.  I can't describe them.  Just get some."Do I feel guilty about noshing on fabulous Strawberry Napoleons and Jewish Pizza (kind of like a modified, yet TOTALLY delicious fruitcake bar) at 10:15am?  Hecks, naw... But they do have quiche and some other breakfast-y items for those who prefer a more traditional approach to your stomach's opening ceremony.""Just go early :)  They open at 10 on Saturdays.  And bring cash...it's easier that way."""There is no better place in Pittsburgh for interesting baked goods.  I wait in line with my daughter (who is 14 and only gets up early on a weekend when we are coming here:) on Saturdays and it is worth it.  We are foodies and cook a lot at home so let me hit some highlights:  the ham and cheese sandwiches are to die for and i hesitate to let you all know that; the biscuits are crazy good..dense and moist; the key lime cake is the best i've ever; amazing pepperoni rolls; the chocolate tulip is death by chocolate and delicious!  We haven't eaten our way through everything yet but it's all fantastic."Lisa""""We were visiting our friends who live close by, it was raining on a Saturday morning, our friends told my boyfriend and I to go here and get a ham sandwich. A ham sandwich? We thought. Yes a ham sandwich. My bf grabbed two to go while I waited in the car and we started eating and driving, eating these warm buttery wonderful tiny ham sandwiches. 5 minutes later we drove back to food glorious food , this time I hoped out of the car and ran in , got 3 more and ran back to the car. I'm not a foodie, I'm not a meat lover, I rarely eat breakfast. ........ But........ These were to die for!!!! How could a tiny little ham sandwich taste so good?  The people that worked there, a young woman and a very young (teenager?) man we're so sweet and friendly,  the pastries were sitting all around on trays looked amazing too! Very small and charming inside, just like you want French cafes to be.  When we go to house sit for our friends next month, I will be a gaining few pounds a week on ham sandwiches. It might be the most savory 3 weeks of my life.""My sister, husband, and I went in after early dinner. It was completely unplanned but we were attracted to the quaint storefront. We purchased a crispy elephant ear-like dessert sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. It was glorious. I bought a piece of apple-walnut-cinnamon sugar cake with cream cheese frosting. It was delicious an moist. We also purchased freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. They were absolutely rich and scrumptious. The woman who was there an greeted us seemed like she might be the owner. She was sweet and very helpful. Great disposition. This is probably my favorite small bakery in Pittsburgh. Delightful."I can't even. "Perfectly delicious food, reminds me of a true French bakery. Delectable cakes, pastries, chocolatey things, as well as savory quiches, breads, and their signature little marinated ham sammies. "I used to be a regular here on Saturday mornings and would spend $20-30 bc I'd get 4-5 things to last me through the week. Ha! That never worked out. It lasted about 3 days. "The last time I went, the person working the counter was really unfriendly. But hey, maybe they're trying to really nail that French bakery vibe :)  No matter, the baked goods redeemed this cranky lady.""""Food glorious foooood, hot sausage and MUStard...""Actually they don't sell hot sausage and mustard but, you know. ""They do have amazing ham and cheese sandwiches, that are kinda pricy, but oh so good. And if you want them, you better get there early on the weekend! They're small, so get 2 for yourself at least :)""We've also tried the Nutella tart, which i've had twice now because it's SO DELICIOUS. The fruit tart is not bad, cinnamon buns are great, jewish pizza is ok (not what I was expecting - it's kinda like a fruitcake - like the dreaded holiday kind - but denser and drier), strata (eggy bread dish) which was pretty good, key lime cake - so so good, and quiche (good). ""Seating is hit or miss, since there's only a few tables (3 of them seat 4 people, 1 seats 2 people). On a quieter morning you should be able to find a seat. They serve coffee as well (nothing to write home about), $2 a cup, but if you like coffee with your dessert like me, it's nice to have.""""Came across this place after checking out a Thai restaurant across the street. The name intrigued my family and I, and it looked like adorable from the outside. ""I fell in love instantly. And came back several times after first discovering this hidden gem. You walk in and the wonderful smells just overwhelm you in just an amazing way. The ambiance is that of an old style kitchen- personally, it reminds me of one of my aunts kitchens, which gives it that homey feel that is so comforting. They have seating- which I never saw in any bakeries prior to this one. They also serve coffee and encourage you to take a seat and enjoy your sweet treat. ""They offer such a unique array of sweets. Definitely not your typical bakery. Pies, tortes, mooses and cookies.. And when they do have cinnamon rolls, grab them! They are a hot commodity! My personal favorite is their key lime pie. Oh my goodness. It's amazing. They have had it every time that I came, thank goodness. Their key lime cake is phenomenal as well. Their fruit tarts are incredible, the chocolate moose is amazing- they have a lot of items with fresh fruit which I love! ""My only critiques- the hours: they are closed on Mondays and Sundays :/, not ideal for someone whose only day off is typically Sunday. And also, they write all the items thy have in the case on a small chalkboard posted on the wall to the right of the case. Every time I go, I find myself asking the employees what everything is, which I find to be a little annoying. Regardless- it's worth it. It's such a hidden gem and going there and experiencing their sweets is a real treat.""""This is the best little bakery in Pittsburgh!  My favorites include: key lime cake, biscuits, strata and their ham sandwiches!  The line is always out the door, but you won't be disappointed!""The best desserts in Pittsburgh I've ever had, bar none. I've had pecan pie, key lime pie, lilac cake (which is basically the best white cake you'll ever have), broccoli/cheese & mushroom quiches, biscuits, coconut cream pie. The crusts are exquisite, too. Everything tastes homemade, yet from the nicest home in the city.""My sister and I were walking her dog when she told me about the cinnamon rolls at Food Glorious Food. She said that they were incredible but that they sold out really quickly after the store opened. We happened to walk past the store at 10:15 AM (the store opened at 10 that day), so we decided to try our luck. We arrived just in time, and we managed to snag the very last cinnamon roll (at least at the moment; maybe they make more later, but I'm not sure). We also got three macarons: one blue velvet, one PB&J, and one salted caramel. All of these items totaled to $9, which I think it a pretty good deal. ""The cinnamon roll was outstanding. It was soft, buttery, and perfectly sweet. All of the macarons were top notch too. They had thin, crispy shells with a chewy inside and subtle but still very recognizable (and tasty) fillings. ""If you are in the Highland Park area, you should absolutely treat yourself to the delicious baked goods at Food Glorious Food.""""This bakery is amazing!  We stopped on a whim after eating breakfast next door because the place looked cute and we are so glad that we did.  We got a chocolate chip cookie, a piece of their signature white cake with raspberry filling, a raspberry filled kolache, a cinnamon dough oval, and a brownie.  Everything was delicious!  The service was exceptional. There was a line out the door as we were leaving at about 11:30am. We will certainly go back as we are fussy about our baked goods and this place meets our standards.""White Lily Cake, bought the first time because I liked the name.  Now my family expects me to bring it to all family functions!  It is beautiful to look at and delicious to taste!""This place fills a void in Pittsburgh: a genuinely from-scratch bakery in the East End. I got a sampling of cookies, a quiche, a ham and cheese bun, a raspberry kolachie, and a cinnamon bun. Every item was uniquely simple and delicious."I ordered a pan of biscuits for my Saturday brunch and I can't wait to pick them up."I felt like I was in my great aunts kitchen. It's an extremely inviting and personal experience, I'll be a regular here from now on. ""La Gourmandine is an amazing French bakery, but the atmosphere and quality at Food Glorious Food is something more than panache, it feels like home.""""I walk by this place every Wednesday, and until today I had never poked my head inside. I was super hungry, it's raining, and the store smells SO GOOD, so I couldn't resist.""The person helping me was super patient and nice while I asked about basically everything in the case (checking for gelatin, you know). Also, they take credit card!""Anyway I settled on a pumpkin roll, which was amazing. First, the slices are huge. Second, the ratio of cream cheese frosting to cake is high, but I love it like that. Third, the flavor overall was perfect, not too sweet.""Can't wait until next Wednesday!""""I moved to Pgh from San Francisco in 2010, and every single dealing I've had with AAA since I moved here has been great -- straightforward, super helpful people, and mostly quite brief wait times. ""The agent that I have worked with from the start, whose name I think is Heather (long dark hair, second desk from the left), has always been willing to spend as much time with me as I needed to understand what I was buying and/or the process that I needed to go through.""Also, my car was totaled a couple of years ago (some jagoff who was texting rear-ended me, ahem, please don't do this), and they were phenomenal. I had a check for the full amount in less than a week.""I see a lot of negative reviews here for services that are title related. I don't know if those people are even AAA employees, they might be DOT for all we know. I've had three title transactions, including one for a car that was from out of state, and they all went smoothly. ""I've been with AAA for more than 40 years, and when I lived in California I was seriously considering switching. Not anymore.""""It is so painful for me to give this place a 5 star review, but when I think back to the bad times I've had here, it's because I was in a terrible mood when I walked in and it just didn't get better. ""When you come here, be prepared to wait. I routinely wait for about an hour. Seems ridiculous? It used to piss me off but now I bring a magazine. ""It is better to have a AAA membership when you go here because you will get a discount, but it is the only DMV in the area. It is convenient because of that, and they do validate parking.""I recently bought an SUV out of state. The transfer could not have been easier, even with the messed up mileage written down by the idiot I bought it from. Can you believe he actually tried to sell me the truck with a Bill of Sale?? Yeah, um NO! (I'm just justifying calling him an idiot).""You can get pretty much everything done here, even get your license renewed. Do not go here on the weekend. It is a zoo. And don't go here during lunch hours during the week. Around 2 in the afternoon on a weekday has done me well. ""Just be patient and treat the employees with respect, and you will get out of here in one piece and maybe even in a good mood!"""This library is so close to the east liberty shops and development projects. It is a half a block away from the Borders and Walgreens. You can take out a limit of 50 books and they have tables of fiction bestsellers and a great cookbook selection. Good place to go this summer for something to read and not spend a dime..."Well, I just moved to Shadyside from Oakland so I'm used to perusing the lovely stacks at CLP Main. I finally made my way here a month after moving and was pleased with the selection. It's not as extensive as main, but it couldn't be since it's much more compact! If you want something from another branch you can request to pick it up here. They also had a lot of computers to use, chairs for sitting to read and a decent magazine selection. It's bright, modern, airy and I have no complaints. Other than I couldn't use the self-checkout because it was being wonky, but that's technology for you :)"Great place for East Liberty to have this library and it's so close to my house. I love it here. Also it's nice and quiet here. Great addition for the African American community of east liberty. I love the section of books they have. Come down and visit this awesome place!!!"I've only been there a few times but it was a nice place - good staff, they mix drinks well, and it's a friendly atmosphere.""This is one of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh. It's a bit edgier than most of the others bars in the area, which also gives it a lot more character. This place is one of the closest things that reminds me of an urban-artsy feel that I'm used to in Southern CA. ""Shadow supports local artists and has weekly open mics. Only downside is I'm not used to paying a cover for open-mic sessions, but I understand an establishment needs to raise some dough. The drinks are decent and there are many local and big artists that come here for shows. ""Always good vibes at Shadow!"""Among the best of the 'burgh.  Great live acts on a regular basis."Dear Shadow Lounge, ""I miss you. You're wonderful in every way. The dance parties, the live music, the poetry slams, the local art, the totally reasonable drink prices, the cute and chill proprietor eye candy...I could go on. "Stay awesome. "Xoxo,""Andrea""""As a Brooklyn based live indie-electronic/hiphop performer that travels, Shadow Lounge is by far one of my all time favorites.  As a Pittsburgh native remembering it's first opening when it was just bboys, graff heads, MC's and DJ's doing their local thing, it's amazing to see this place has become so professional, original, and really stands-out and is positively active for the community and continuing growth of Pittsburgh.  The service is delightful on both sides (AVA/Shadow Lounge), the prices are just right, the sound system is a complete BANGER with crisp and clean sound.   The crowd is mad cool and always responsive to good music.  Shadow Lounge really holds it down for Pittsburgh's scenes no matter the genre.  Can't visit Pittsburgh without stopping by Shadow Lounge.""I'm a newbie in Pittsburgh and have lived in California almost all of my life. Most recently I was living in the San Francisco Bay Area where dope lounges, clubs, cafes are bountiful. Ever since the first time I stepped foot in Shadow Lounge a sense of familiarity and peace overwhelmed me. Gotta give it up to the owner, Justin, for creating such a unique and welcoming venue in Pittsburgh, I can honestly say that both Shadow and Ava Lounge have become one of my new favorite kick it spots hands down!""Loved everything from the ownership, to the crowd, to the live music. LOVED how everyone seemed to actually be dancing, and not just standing and staring on the side lines. Did I mention that it was a live 10 person salsa band? Yes, yet another oxymoron: salsa and snow... Again.. Only in Pittsburgh!""Went several nights in a row: Thursday, Saturday & Sunday. I cannot say enough how much I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!! Every night was different: African night, Latin Dance, Brass Band (that was amazing). The Ownership is way friendly & open to chatting which I love. The bartenders are open, friendly & genuine...anyone who remembers my name & my drink is a winner in my book! It shows they are listening when they actually ask you a question! The ownership was willing to allow us to order & set on fire a Flaming Dr. Pepper.....had to bring a little Southern treasure North! ;)""I love the diverse, yet open and friendly crowd each night. I felt right at home."Now for the real surprise....THE FOOD!!!We ordered the~Tortas 7.00...we got one Chicken & one Steak..both were perfect!"Sandwiches with your choice of tofu or breaded chicken.  Served on toasted bread or multi-grain wrap with melted mozzarella cheese, fried bean spread, avocados, tomatoes, and onions. Topped with a chipotle sauce"Cheese Steak Torta 9.00"Grilled steak served on toasted bread or multi-grain wrap with onions, peppers, mozzarella cheese, fried bean spread, topped with guacamole and chipotle sauce""I was shocked & amazed at how wonderful this """"bar food"""" was. The tortas were great & the guacamole homemade. ""I will be back every time I am in Pittsburgh!""""On Tuesday nights, they have open mic. On my birthday (4-12), I went here to check off another life list item...SPOKEN WORD! I did it! The crowd was open & welcoming to all that performed. There are some awesome artists in Pittsburgh! Also for $5.00, I got a basket of tortilla chips and 3 homemade dips: guacamole, black bean and a verde salsa...all were delicious & for $5.00 it was A LOT!""They are showing out behind the bar!!! Last night, I had several of their new drinks: key lime pie martini...AMAZING, my best friend is black...DELICIOUS, strawberry, lemonade and basil, not my fav, but tasty. The key lime pie martini and the steak burrito are a great pairing! I continue to love this place, the people there, the overall atmosphere more than any other place I have experienced in the bar/lounge scene."Combinacion!This place is the shit for real.Where's the Patron at???"(b)""""Absolutely amazing! Great staff and service! Best music in Pittsburgh, hands down.  Good work guys!"I wish I were cool enough to hang out here...I am not. "However, that does not stop me from going from time to time and trying to blend in with the cool crowd. ""In all seriousness, this place is great. A laid back vibe with the best music and best bar in town. And when I say best music...I MEAN best music. Best Jazz night in Pittsburgh on Mondays, great classic hip hop, and other genres that you don't hear anywhere else in Pittsburgh.""The owner is awesome and will talk music with you any time he has a moment. If you are a music nerd, come early and chat it up with Justin. he knows his stuff and will chat it up with you. I promise you will love chatting with him. Very cool guy. ""And of course the bartenders...all great. Very friendly. Will make you whatever you want, or mix up something special and surprise you if you would like. Again...I'm probably not cool enough to hang out with them, but when I am hanging out at the bar, they never remind me of that."""One of the most eclectic venues in Pittsburgh. Shadow Lounge has a great variety of acts that it pulls in."I just went to their Titletown Soul & Funk Party and it was a really great time. Great music, fun crowd, pretty decent prices on drinks. I'll definitely be going back for Titletown and in general, Shadow Lounge is a great place to see alternative acts in Pittsburgh."""Best jazz open mic I've ever seen. Possibly the best in the U.S."Um, amazing. Is this real life? Or is it just a shadow? Just kidding about that joke. But seriously, I was blown away by the drinks, specials, servers, food, manager, space....that I couldn't understand why it wasn't packed on a Monday night that happened to be Martin Luther King Day! Callen (I think I am spelling her name right) is an incredibly sweet, efficient, and talented bartender; Solomon on the grill whips up a KILLER (but without death; veg friendly) tofu and bean fried taco; and Justin is an offbeat, dry, and very cool bar owner who is interested in providing an open space for his community - they have held a huge number of widely different acts in the past, and plan for more in the future! Look out! Geeeez, guys, AND you have drink specials erry dey? Thank God I got there on $4 margarita night. Nothing impresses me more than a dern good margarita, I don't care if it comes in a tall glass.""The bar itself (I don't think we're in AVA anymore, Toto...) can get mildly confusing if you don't bother to learn the layout until you're three margaritas deep, so let me advise you in advance: AVA is the part that is glowing green, and feels like a cozy, well, lounge...Shadow Lounge is the rest. There is a large, yellow room containing the main stage, and a blue, intimate room with a half-bar. ""Who wants to go with me on a Wednesday for ~experimental~craft~drink~ night? Oh, and no, they're not hiring."""Love this place!I remember DJing here on many occasions in the Shadow Lounge and at AVA. I've always had a great time here an all of the memories I've had here could fill up a book on it's own. Thanks to TIm and Justin for everything....really. Thanks for operating one of the realest venues to ever come up in Pittsburgh (second to Club Laga...I miss you). They put me on when on no one else did and gave me my first legitimate DJ gig ever back in 2007. I still have the pictures. "I remember seeing Wiz Khalifa at the Shadow back in 2005. He opened up for Mr. Complex of Polyrhythm Addicts fame (yes the Shadow has came correct on putting on the best hip-hop acts in Pittsburgh history in it's existence). Wiz was wearing a black Nike hoodie with a swoosh on the side with Levis and white Air Force 1s. To even think that I could see someone like Wiz come up from playing at the Shadow lounge to becoming...seriously...freaking HUGE as he did really holds a testament to what the Shadow Lounge was and always will be about. I've managed to meet some amazing people in my years hanging out at the Shadow lounge and that's seriously more than enough. If it wasn't live hip-hop, it was DJs playing the freshest music...everything from funk, soul, reggae, R&B, breaks, house, techno, and everything in between. The addition of the bar was just money! And the blue room...really with all of that going it really had a vibe I have not seen anywhere else really.""But other than that, I don't think I could say anything else than the Shadow Lounge has been my favorite spot in Pittsburgh and the people who made this place worthwhile really did. I live in New York now and I wish I could stop by one last time. The Shadow is awesome to anyone that comes through from all over, but if you managed to take in the scene and frequent it on a weekly basis from back in early to mid 00s to now knew it was bringing something special and it was something special. You can rarely find that certain places in my experiences with bars and clubs...but when you can find it, it's incredible.""I heard the place is closing at the end of March and I had to show some love. Peace.""""When I go out I like a more mature ,diverse crowd -which I have to admit, some places in Pittsburgh can not offer.  Ava offers that and then some.  The atmosphere is awesome and gives off a neo soul vibe.  All of the Bartenders are friendly and can mix a mean drink (especially Asante) This is the only place I will go for happy hour or just to chill and have a drink.  Justin and staff keep up the awesome job ...Ava is my favorite spot, and I  would and have recommend  it !!!!"I love this store. I can just spend hours walking around getting ideas of things to either update or change around my house.All of the sales associates are very helpful and knowledgeable. Sometimes it's hard to find someone to help you because they are busy helping other customers."They even cut keys that actually work.""""I've been to the Glass Center perhaps 5 or so times now. I've gone for a tours/demonstrations and two ""Make It Now"" classes. I have thoroughly enjoyed going each and every time. Some of the art they have on display is fantastic. It was interesting the last time I went because local artists were there to sell glass work they made.""The Make It Now classes are well worth $25. You get to be somewhat involved in creating the object (You get to pick the color, blow the glass, and do a couple of other things. You never get too hot to the ovens or do anything dangerous at all. If you want to be more involved, there are other more advanced classes that you can take), plus you have a wonderful piece of art to take home! I've made an ornament and pumpkin so far and will be making a flower soon. The instructors have all been very nice and helpful as well, making the experience even better.""I can't wait to go back!""""I LOVE the glass center. I've been lucky enough to attend quite a few events here, and also do a small class where I was able to make an ornament. The staff is always friendly and fun, and I always leave feeling grateful that we have such a unique place here in Pittsburgh!""The Glass Center is a marvelous addition the Pittsburgh cultural scene.  They are a gallery, a place to take classes, a center for glass artists in residence, and much more.  Whether you are taking a tour, a class, or visiting the gift shop or gallery, there's a lot to see and learn here.  I've taken tours several times with different groups, but I always learn something new and I am always impressed by the great work takes place at the Center."They will take students at every level.  Their facility is well run and professionally staffed.  I was delighted to meet their enthusiastic staff."There's a hot shop, a cold shop, a flame shop, and a gallery, so there's lots to see and learn.""""I went to a yelp event here, where we were able to make a fused glass piece and also watch some demonstrations and go to the gallery. Everything in the gallery was amazing. The demonstrations were neat, and the fused glass was something I would go back to do again.""I really didn't know that the glass center was open most of the time, and if you go there on any random day, you can watch whatever is going on. I think that is pretty cool! They also have classes where you can blow glass or make beads or whatever you want... I can't wait to pick up my piece and come back for another class!""""Went here with my girlfriends last Saturday.  They were having a girls night event.  A small bar & desserts were included in the price.  It was $40 per person. We loved it!  We worked closely with a glass artist.  We didn't just watch, we were acutally doing it!  We made glass flowers, I can't wait to pick mine up!  (It takes a few days.)  I definitely recommend this as something different to do with friends or on a date! My one friend did a glass blowing event there & said that this was much more HANDS ON than the glass blowing was.""I'm always looking for unique ways to spend Valentine's Day.  This year, I celebrated by doing a make-it-now at the Glass Center with CM.  This event was held the evening of the day before Valentine's Day (2/13, a Fri.).  I'd been to the Glass Center in fall 2013 to observe an exhibition during RADical days, and had been meaning to try out a make-it-now, so this event provided the perfect opportunity to try my hand at glass craftsmanship as a novice.""For the V-Day event, you could choose between three items to make: a glass flower, a heart pendant, and a glass tile.  CM and I chose to make a glass flower, so upon checking into the glass center, we were told to go upstairs and check in at the hot shop.  Upon doing so, there was a 15-20 min. wait, given that many other couples were scheduled to do the activity at around the same time.  We passed the time by helping ourselves to some of the snacks that the Glass Center thoughtfully provided for participants.""When we were called, we worked with an instructor from the Glass Center (I forget his name) to make our flower.  He first demonstrated the steps involved in the process, explaining each of them in turn.  We then chose the colors and design of our flower, and proceeded to work with our instructor to carry out each of the steps.  He was very patient and helpful throughout the whole process, despite our characteristic clumsiness!  Despite the amount of people and molten glass in the studio, crafting our flower was a breeze and a lot of fun, thanks to his guidance!""After making our flower, we had to rush across the street because we had reservations for dinner at Verde.  After finishing dinner, we returned and observed the other make-it-now activities--the pendant in particular was fun to watch.  After they wrapped up, we went to the gallery to check out the glass art exhibit, which featured an arts program in Wilkinsburg.  We were even able to participate in it by adding to a mosaic that would be displayed at the program.  Finally, we checked out some of the glass art on exhibit by artists using the Glass Center in the foyer.""Overall, we had an amazing time making our flower at the Glass Center during the V-Day make-it-now, and strongly recommend it as a unique V-Day activity.  The price was reasonable ($35), the activity was fun, and the staff was friendly.  The only drawbacks were: (1) it was crowded, due to the popularity of the event, and (2) you have to wait three days to pick up your item so that it can cool properly. Obviously, however, there's not much the Glass Center can do about them, so I'm awarding 5 stars for one of the most unique and fun venues and activities in PGH!"""The best church in Pittsburgh! If you are new to the Pittsburgh area or are just looking for a new church to belong to then your search is over! "One thing I love about Mt. Ararat is that it's not a black church or a white church, but it's a church for all people of all colors and races. Pastor Curtis is one of the best teachers and preaches I have ever heard! ""Men's bible study is on the first Monday of the month at 7pm. Regular bible study is on Tuesdays at 12 noon and 6pm. Saturday night live worship service is at 7pm. Sunday morning worship times are 7am, 9:30 and 11:45am. If you can't make it to Tuesday evening bible study or worship service on Sunday you can watch them on the churches website. "There are even shuttles to pick you up in Oakland if you are a college student and would like to go Sunday worship service. "Not to mention the Rement Choir is amazing. They came in second place in the 2009 National How Sweet The Sound Choir Competition! They have put out two Cd's. The second one, Only Jesus was recently released and it is amazing! "They even have a separate youth worship service during the 11:45 service for children from six all the way to teenager's. If you go to the 11:45 service on Sunday you'll see me in the balcony during the spring and summer and at the 9:30 service during football season."http://www.mt-ararat.org/""""This church seems to have it all, great preaching, amazing choir and they seem to be servicing the community in so many wonderful ways. Honestly I can't say enough great things about this church. Love it!""This place does gorgeous updos for $25 apiece. My bridesmaids and I went there on the day of (with no trial run beforehand) and we all had beautiful hair exactly the way we wanted it. The hairdressers are so friendly and attentive and so accommodating in letting 5 of us take over their relatively small shop for 2 hours on a Saturday. I was so happy to find them, and so happy not to pay $60+ a pop for wedding party hair!"Got my hair done in an updo (for only $25!!!!)  yesterday for my wedding.  they did amazing!  they listened to what i wanted and although it took quite a while (i have really long hair) she spent the time to do it right and exactly how i wanted it.  great service!!   The price is not high but the quality is!"Michelle is a godsend; went in for a simple, fuss-less updo and was stunned by the result. She is quite the perfectionist, and for $25, her mastery is bizarrely affordable. Forever bookmarked. (Note: street parking can be fairly difficult to find on S. Highland so scour the smaller adjacent streets for a free 2 hours.)"Great for a quick cut.  $22 for extreme attention to detail and excellent finish.Rosemary is amazing for updos. Only $25 a piece but great attention to detail!"I went in to get a haircut. Never been here before and had no preference as to which beautician did it. The place is fun! Mainly due to no nonsense people that work there. It isn't a glamorous spot like so many other salons in shadyside, but you get experienced people with great sense of humor and down to earth attitude, that above all listen to what you want. I ended up with Michelle, and I loved what she did with my hair! It's perfect! $31 overall for a cut and blow dry. I'll be back!""I had been searching for a reasonably priced drycleaner in the East End for months with no success when I stumbled upon Shadyside Valet. I have had items drycleaned and shirts laundered and pressed for several months now. I have also had a vinyl bag and a skirt repaired. Everything is always done well, and I have never had to wait more than a few days for my items to be finished.""The staff is very friendly, and there is usually never a wait. Everything is reasonably priced-about $6 for a skirt or pants, $11 for a suit, and $8 for a dress. Considering the many over-priced alternatives, I was so happy for find this place! Highly recommend.""""This place was a life saver! I got into town late afternoon yesterday and it was pouring. I dropped the dress I was to wear today to a wedding in a huge puddle as I was trying to get stuff out of my car. After talking to them on the phone, they insured me that they could ha e it done by noon today in time for me to wear it. Everyone was busy but so nice to me. And they did a great job with my dress! I am so grateful for their help. It was such an affordable cost too! Recommend this location to anyone in need of an affordable emergency dry clean!""I had great service from these guys, only people in town I could get same day dry cleaning and be able to pick up on Sunday from the Laundry Factory. Going to these people for now on!""I dunno what everyone's negative issues with this place is, been here a few times and it's always been great. Friendly staff, solid service, never been disappointed, don't be detracted by the negative reviews, always been good to me."These dudes are the best. "Great service, great explanations, and their prices are the best in town for an oil change (though this does mean that for oil changes they're always super busy - because they're awesome!)""Highly recommended over nearly any other automotive care company in the vicinity - I've tried them all. These guys are the best.""""I kinda accidentally walked in ten minutes before these guys closed, asking for an oil change.  Oops :/""Like the awesome guys that they are though, they let me know that, while they would do it quickly (like, not check anything else), they would still be okay with doing it.  The guy was super nice about it.""After all of this, he took me out to look over everything, was super friendly, and answered all of my questions.""They are great.  I will be back if I'm ever in this area when I need anything.""""This place is outstanding. I always get great discounts, and all the mechanics are very honest and helpful. I am certainly not rich and Marvin is always willing to assist me with my budget and what needs to be done on my vehicle. I've been given very specific directions on whatever needs to be worked on, taken back to the garage and allowed to see the old/new parts with no hassle. I would definitely recommend going here."Great service! They fit me into a busy schedule within 2 hours of calling and fixed my flat tire for a great price. I will definitely use Midas again after my experience with them."I am new to the area, and was referred to motheral apartments by a friend who currently goes to school in pittsburgh and leases from motheral. I just has a tour of a few places and The leasing agent patty was fantastic, very knowledgeable about the spaces and about the area in general. Apartments were great , very well maintained and a convenient location. Shadyside wasn't really on my radar of places to live, but after this experience it looks like I will be calling shadyside home for a few years !"Great Hoagies! "I always get the Steak Deluxe hoagie and my wife gets the Italian Deluxe and then we give each other half of the other ones hoagie because we can never decide on with one to get."""Good food"I randomly selected this place from my insurance's list of providers for an exam and new glasses. I'm glad I didn't read the lone one-star review on here before I made the appointment. It took about ten minutes after I showed up to be seen. All of the women there were very courteous and the one who helped me pick out frames was just awesome. The doctor who gave me my exam was also super polite and personable, and seemed much more knowledgeable than my last eye doctor. The on-street parking can be tricky, depending on when you go, but this was definitely a positive experience and deserving of a five-star review."The last time I was here must have been an off day (my previous review gave this place one star) My appt was at 9am I was home by 9:30. The receptionist was very nice as well as the Doctor. I was in and out so fast. I've been going to this doctor since I was a kid and I'll continue to go."Believe it or not, this whole foods is actually one of the most successful ones. the location is strange, but it's pretty central for most of the yuppier areas of pittsburgh, and it's the only one in the pittsburgh area. Just for that, they get 5 stars.""This place is a God-sent for a California girl like me. And kudos to them for not being ""afraid"" of East Liberty.""Prices are important, but I care more about what I put in my body. So I get my special needs stuff here, and my basics elsewhere. I can't ding them for costs because you pay for quality. But if cheap costing food matters more than lard, transfats, or hormones found within it, you can always just shop at that other store down the street....""There's a nice sized cafe area, and plenty of space for bikers to park. Cheers to them for friendly & knowledgeable staff and customer discounts for bringing your own bags.""True, the parking lot is a mess, but I attribute that more to:""a) People not knowing how to drive. Because you CAN drive to the back of the parking lot, park, and get inside in half the time it takes to sit in line like a moron who doesn't understand how to drive AROUND a car waiting to park.... and""b) Pittsburgh's lack of urban planning... because it makes sooooo much sense to put an entering & exiting driveway 25 feet away from a three-way intersection on a two lane street. Beautiful.""""I recently visited Whole Foods for the first time in my life, and I was pleasantly surprised.  I was particularly shocked by the prices--not because they're worthy of the ""Whole Paycheck"" nickname, but because they're surprisingly low.  Perhaps the nickname was developed by people who'd previously only shopped at cheap-o supermarkets.""I like the well-stocked salad bar and dining area, and so does the rest of Pittsburgh, apparently.  Half the city was assembling salads during my last visit.  Vegan items are clearly marked as such, and everything is fresh.""""AH!  I am never shopping anywhere else for groceries ever again (except if I want like ketchup and bologna and stuff-- then I'll have to go to giant eagle.)  But, after coming from the middle of nowhere midwest, I cannot tell you how good it feels to see cheese and meat in the grocery store that I actually want to eat.  ""AH!""""I used to think that Whole Foods was too expensive and only for vegetarians. Boy was I wrong! I freaking love this place. They have everything from fresh meats, cheeses, fruits, produce and so much more. Their cakes and other deserts are utterly amazing. "This is also where I fell in love with Naked Juices. They are delicious. "The only thing I don't like is that parking is a bitch at times."""This place gets five stars as it really is the only place in Pittsburgh that I can get the same veggie selection that I can out in Seattle.  Without this whole foods I would be an unhappy camper...  I am specifically talking about the magic that is Field Roast vegan grain 'meat'.  "Yes, it is generally more expensive but what do you expect?  They are a specialty store.  They have a great deli and an outstanding selection of baked goods.  ""It is an oasis for someone like me."""Yes I am a fan and yes I am Shadyside yuppie. Judge me if you want. "I love everything about WF and it is my go-to grocery store. I try not to give my business to GE. WF's hot bar has fed me many many dinners, in exchange for money of course. However, that is what I call money well spent. I agree with the other reviewers that the parking lot can be a little crazy, but I live around here, and it's the norm. I am just glad that there is a huge double decker parking lot. Also, you can always park farther away and not have to deal with the mess. It's good for health! The produce is fresh and for regular grocery you have a wide variety of healthy choices. The cherry on top is that the staff is always friendly, super helpful and happy!""""Forget you Giant Eagle, Giggle, Market Crap etc.  Whole foods gets a bad rap as being ""expensive"" and yes I agree there are some very ridiculously expensive things in there, but this is where you IGNORE them and get your basic essentials.  They are always running specials, and you can get some good deals.  If you actually try to price compare between GE and whole foods, you'll find that whole foods is actually cheaper, and the only reason you don't shop there is because people will feed you into thinking you'll spend your ""whole paycheck"" there.  What crap.  Write a list, prioritize and buy the things that are sale.  Whole foods has a much better selection (freshness wise) in produce, meats, and cheese across the board.  Yes you can find some great stuff in the strip, but you will also find some reasonable items here.  Over the summer I went on a scavenger hunt for clams, Wholeys/GE were both gross and overpriced! Whole foods has fresh clams and they were much cheaper than the other two locations!  Try it out, you won't be sorry."Now with two new bee hives along the rail line as of July 2012 managed by burgh bees of Pittsburgh"I love shopping here. The staff is really nice, no attitudes. Even the other shoppers are kind. It's always nice. Thanks to everyone for making Whole Foods a nice shopping experience."Whole foods!! What a great idea. Foods that are natural and organic and wholesome to bet. This store offers a lot of brands and varieties of food. More than the national brands. "I love how when you first walk in the store, your automatically thrown into the produce section no questioned asked. The store is practically laid out to help you make the best food purchasing options available."They have more organic foods than any other store i've seen. Everything looks so fresh and plentiful. They also have conventional (non-organic) items that are usually shipped locally and not from across the country. Tons of options from Bok Choy to avocados to seasonal fruits. They have a fresh seafood counter and a meat counter with ratings on the meat from one to five. There is also a deli counter with fresh pasta salads and side dishes made in store. "I recently started a gluten free diet and this store meets all my needs from bread, buns, cereal, crackers, basically all the common wheat products. I've substituted out a lot of wheat products like flour and instead use rice flour, regular milk for almond milk, things like that.""My favorite part of the store is there hot foods and salad bar. They make all their dishes in the store and sell them for $8.49lb. The hot dishes are amazingly good. The last time i went i had green beans with red peppers, cajun sweet potato wedges, sauteed mushrooms, curry tofu and purple cabbage. Man was it delicious!!!! Plus the salad bar has over 40 options to put on top of the salad!. With so many choices including the bakery, how can you miss out on this great place. It caters to average diets and changing diets too!!!"""Not counting price I like this store and the service. "My favorite, a fellow I call Scotsman the meat counter man. I don't know if this gentleman is from Scotland or not, but his language reminds me of one I know. But the key distinguishing factor for him is his superb service and great attitude. He is just  short of your personal butcher. He takes his time with you, and he does not rush you on. Listens, gives advice and is extremely helpful. When necessary he will look in the back to satisfy your request . He alone could keep me coming back. Oh, and also the meat counter is excellent overall. Great selection,  and good cuts.""What else, well the cheese section is outstanding, the prepared foods are plentiful and tasty. I like the baked goods also. Another nice feature is you can eat right there, which I do sometimes so I don't food shop when starving, which always costs me more somehow."""This is where we do all of our grocery shopping. The parking lot does suck so I avoid it and park by Walgreens or up on the top lot. The produce is always great. Seafood is delicious. Best meat in the city- we especially love the made in store sausages. I love the specialty department and they will let you try the cheese before you buy and everyone is so helpful. We eat from the prepared food department more than I'd like but it is better then ordering take out or chipotle for the second time in one week. Salad bar is good- though watch out for undercooked veggies- raw beets on a salad one too many times and now I avoid them completely. Bakery department is beautiful and when I ordered a sheet cake for a wedding shower everyone raved about it. Floral department will help you put together a beautiful arrangement. Whole body wants all of my money- I try to avoid this department to be honest because I lack self control and always over spend. "Check out can be a hassle if it's really busy but the cashiers are nice and check out pretty quickly. A recent development at this store is the person waiting outside to help you to your car. I don't need help so it's a little weird but I'm sure people with kids love it.""""All that I can say is WOWSA!!!!!!!!! This review is long overdue! I will state it outright that I'm very particular about my food, and I've been known to stomp my food like a brat when my heart's set on that vegan tofu burrito from the fresh pack section and it's not available. ""A few months ago, when this happened, I sulked at the Prepared Foods counter, and Bethany, prepared foods customer service extraordinaire, flew to my rescue. She suggested the vegan BLT. I was hesitant, as I wanted something hearty and filling, and let me tell you this!... The sandwich totally did her smile and sales pitch justice. It pleased me like no other sandwich has ever done. I want to compliment every sandwich maker in that department, specifically Bethany, Eric, and Rick. They know when I walk in their direction from the Fresh Pack section that I'm looking for my second option of the BLT because the burrito isn't available. No matter how bananas and certifiably insane I might seem during my food shopping excursions, they always treat me with such dignity and respect.""Months have passed since my first BLT experience, and I was completely taken for another ride through satisfaction land during this past week when they offered to notify me """"the night before when the vegan tofu burritos are being made"""" because they know how much I have my heart set on that beautiful meal on most days of the week. I can't say enough for Bethany and her team of prepared foods colleagues. ""And everyone else at the store is so helpful and nice, too! So kind! So informative! I love Whole Foods Market of Pittsburgh! AND, for icing on the review cake, they've even begun to carry Brad's Raw Pizza Kale Chips for dogs. So my dog is satisfied, too. And it's her opinion that ultimately matters. ;) Five stars! Thank you!!!!!!!!!""""I drive 30 min to go to this particular Whole Foods.  The employees are top notch!  Even when they are busy stocking shelves they never mind helping out the customer.  Even taking time to walk you to the particular item that you've asked about!  I feel some of the prices are better than other local grocery stores.  I really appreciate the explanation of how they label their meats.  I probably get most of my toiletries, meat, and veggies from Whole Foods!!  Can't wait for the South Hills location!!!""Alright, so I braved this place yesterday (new years eve) and it was totally insane. There was honking, some road rage and confusion. But I will say that I should have known better coming into a grocery store before a major partying holiday.  ""Anyway, in terms of produce this place is awesome. I got my meat and bacon from this joint and have not been disappointed. I also love their premade hamburgers. They are delish. This is also a great place to find a great assortment of cheeses and grass fed butter ( I go for the kerry gold products, they are just awesome).  ""Also if you are grilling and dont want to cook too many sides, you can pick up some of their sides from their deli section. I haven't had a bad experience with their food and you can always give everything a taste before having the clerk put it in a container.  This is certainly the place to get specialty items like hemp seeds, chia seeds, and other natural dietary supplements... just beware they are not cheap. Overall, whole foods is not cheap, but if you want quality this is the place to go. Just dont go here on New Year's Eve or Christmas Eve... you'll end up ripping your hair out!!"""Great place to eat and shop. Never a dull moment. This place change the face of east Liberty for the better. I was still shop here for all my needs. Love you WFM!!Awesome place Great costumer service Lots of groceries should learn from them "Will come again"""My favorite grocery store in Pittsburgh. When I lived with my parents in forest hills it was worth the 15 to 20 minute drive to shop here. Lots and lots of organic produce. Everything you would need to stock your fridge and pantry plus lots of more exotic options too. Much of the produce comes in conventionally farmed and organic options so pay attention to the labels and signs if you're aiming for all organic. It is more expensive to shop here than most grocery stores but you really do get what you pay for. "The bulk section has lots of nuts, seeds, beans and grains.""The meat counter looks pretty great with some grass fed and organic options (a bit out of my price range for every day eating but its good to know its there for a special occasion). Their seafood counter is passable (that being said, I worked at Wholey's fish market for a while so I have really high standards when it comes to seafood. Not that Wholeys fish always meets my standards, but I'm used to huge variety and at least a few incredibly fresh options). Much of the seafood is previously frozen because it's out of season or exorbitantly expensive when fresh. I honestly can't believe people who shop at whole foods have any interest in irresponsibly farmed fish like tilapia and Chilean Atlantic salmon but they carry it nonetheless. "Staff are friendly but can't always answer what you might think is a simple question. As in the bulk foods guy probably knows everything about the bulk foods but literally has no clue where you can find horseradish.Salad bar and hot foods are good and seam fresh. The sushi is passable if you're really in the mood for quick sushi. There's not a very big baked good section and I've never tried what they do have but my dad likes their cookies. "I usually bike there now, but when I used to drive the parking lot was sort of a mess. Just be prepared to walk from the far end (I'm sure you'll all survive). ""Lines at the registers can be long but seem to move fast. People complain so much about how crazy busy this place is, but they have obviously just never been to the whole foods in Columbus circle NYC.""""I found out the caterpillar in the romaine bag. Eww it climbed up on my arm. Goosebumps :( BUT at least it can be the proof of ""organic"" besides the bug was green!!!! So healthy !""I've read some critical reviews, mostly from others who report coming from more fabulous locations. I live an hour outside of Pittsburgh where Giant Eagle is the only option, and so a trip to Whole Foods is like a visit to the Mother Land, with amazing organic options like sprouts (unheard of where I live). I love love love this Whole Foods and look forward to going, whenever I can get there.""Meatless Monday is a great way to raise awareness about vegetarian or vegan diet, which also happens to be the least arduous way to reduce your carbon footprint, save water, prevent ecological pollution, and reduce deforestation, because it requires so much energy to raise animals for food. When we can simply, and deliciously, I might add eat what they eat. 1 pound of ground beef requires 550 gallons of water. I was there on Monday and I had a really good feature dish, with pink rice from Madagascar and tofu, marinated in a ginger orange dressing (delicious) served with kale, carrots, pumpkin seeds, red & green onions, and a coconut yogurt dressing. The young chef was very nice and knowledgeable, and quite comfortable, talking while making my dinner. I paid for it, blessed it, thanked all who made it possible, ate, and it was awesome!  I went back to thank and compliment the chef. He seemed grateful. Then I got a few groceries I needed and left. Thanks to cool chef, and Whole Foods team! I'll be back soon enough!"This place is thee coolest! Looking to rent a tiki stand? Done! Need a 50's style diner set. They have it! Want a life-size Broadway sign? You're in the money here!Anything and everything you can think of to rent is right at your disposal here. I was in love the moment I stepped into the place. And guess what? You can even rent it out for an event! So that unique wedding venue... it is here! Who wouldn't want to party among Bourbon Street in the comfort of East Liberty? "Holds up to 150 and around 90 seated. Only drawbacks are you must use valet, as there's really no parking around the area. You aren't able to bring in your own catering, but you can use one of five companies they suggest. Which is honestly better than only having one to choose from. ""So if you find yourself in need of a unique venue in Pittsburgh, look no further!"""This.is.so.awesome!  Do you need a lounge set-up?  A giant 007 sign?  A large giraffe?  Go to the Prop Shop.  They have just about anything you can think of available to rent AND you can also rent the space."The owner was telling us that a couple had a rehearsal dinner (or possibly reception) here and each area had a different theme.  Sushi amongst geisha props, antipasto platters in the Italy area, etc.  That's just one of the things that has been done with the space.  While they do have exclusive caterers, they have many for you to pick from.  There are also valet services available (the parking is....so-so), so holding an event for up to 150 will go off without a hitch.""I'm not sure when I'll need that giant giraffe, but if I do, I know exactly where to go.""""Great experience! We hired the Prop Shop for a business dinner function in Salamanca, New York. The Prop Shop team traveled from Pittsburgh to set up and tear down our function in the same day, they did a great job. Our group enjoyed the pool tables, foosball, air hockey, monster basketball and chic seating arrangements. Everyone felt like a kid again. Great activity for business and families alike. Professional and friendly staff!"So the whole reason why I chose this Aamco was because it was a short walk from my apartment in Shadyside and I could easily leave my car there and walk home without having to bum a ride from my roommate.  All I needed was an oil change and my PA state inspection and it turned out to be a pretty painless experience.  I just dropped off my car in the morning and picked it up in the afternoon.  It's hard to find a decent mechanic and Larry and his team seem like people who will take good care of you.  I'll be back there for sure.I was incredibly nervous about taking my car to a major chain as I've heard and read many mixed reviews about numerous locations. My experience at this Aamco was fantastic though!"Larry was incredibly kind and helpful in explaining what was wrong with my transmission, and when it came time to fix it, he ended up charging me the originally estimated cost even though he needed to do a little extra work. ""Can't recommend this place enough!"""I have taken my car here now for seven months (two cars really).  From routine maintainence to identifying a problem they have only shown me the best service.   They always present me with good and complete information and are honest and trustworthy.   The last time I was in they saw the problem right away and since it was a 30 second fix they didn't charge me.  "I can't recommend these guys enough.  The best mechanic I have had experiences with in my adult life!""""I've taken my car to Larry, aka Aamco, the first time because my brakes had been squeaking for months. Asked Larry to change my brake pads and he said. ""No."" He said there was still 80% wear left on them. He said just bring them back in a year or so when they need changing while explaining the squeaking was due to a lower quality material aftermarket pad that my guy in San Diego had installed. Stand up guy. Stand up service. ""Now it's been a year, so I'm taking my car in to actually get it worked on with confidence.""""I took my car here for the state inspection. I mean, there's really not much to rate here - they gave me a sticker, didn't try to sell me anything (my car is like a year old, anyways) and the price was as advertised. They gave me a ride to work, and were quite friendly. ""I'll most likely come back for my future inspection needs, and, if I have a car out of warranty, certainly give them a try for mechanical issues.""""So I had to take my car to get inspected in order to register my car here in PA and ended up taking it to this place.  I called in advance, the day of and they were able to fit me in since I needed to get this done ASAP. Anyway, I drop the car off in the AM and walk over to the closest Starbucks (its like 3 blocks away) so that I can get my work done, as they don't have WIFI.  After 3 hours or so, Larry calls me and lets me know that my car was ready. Fortunately, my car didn't need any work so I was a happy gal. The inspections that they did were about $67 or so, which was pretty average as I had taken my husband to get the same thing done elsewhere. At any rate, the people here were very friendly and professional, they didn't try to sell me anything that was not necessary, which I tend to encounter a fair bit.  Highly recommend.""I needed an oil change and general safety inspection, but I was having trouble finding a place with decent reviews that took appointments and had weekend hours. I called this AAMCO and the guy said that they usually only do transmission work on the weekend, so their mechanics/general tech guys aren't in. However, he offered to schedule me for a Saturday morning appointment as he was going to be in that weekend anyway. I was happy to accept his offer and the actual appointment went very well. The man I spoke with and who worked on my car is very personable and accommodating, and the maintenance he performed on my car was done well and priced fairly. I don't know if they will always be able to accommodate my schedule, but my experience thus far is that they are at least willing to try.""I have a very, very rudimentary base of knowledge when it comes to cars. Mechanics probably pick up this scent within seconds of me walking in the door. So when it came time to get the oil changed in my new-to-me 2010 Honda Civic, I turned to Yelp to help find a place with a solid rating. As far as oil-changing joints go, this AAMCO location stood out among others in the East End. Here's why it gets a high rating in my book...""I called two days ahead of time to schedule. They could take me early Friday morning-- the sooner the better. Well, I was out late celebrating a birthday the night prior and overslept. I called back to reschedule for another day, but they were able to squeeze me in in the afternoon. I went in thinking I was going to be dropping $80 for synthetic oil, but Brian, the shop manager and co-owner is a Honda guy himself and said regular oil would work just fine. I asked him if he could check out the condition of my brakes and tires. Instead of doing a quick visual, he took the tires off to check. Moreover, he rotated them, so my best tires are up front, where they should be. All told, the bill came to under $40 and I was in and out in under an hour.""Along with his business partner, Jim, Brian took over the AAMCO in the latter half of 2014 and he officially became a co-owner on 1 December. He has years of experience working on cars, first as a hobby, and then after a long time in the restaurant business, as an employed mechanic. The customer service was great. I was greeted promptly and with a handshake. After returning to pick up my car, Brian and I spoke for about 10 minutes after the shop had closed for the day. He has plans to renovate the shop to make it better for both his customers and employees, as well as to offer deals through social media.""I'll need tires soon and brake job down the line-- I'll be returning to AAMCO for both. It was great walking away not only with the feeling that I didn't get screwed this time around, but that I have a reliable, knowledgeable place where I can go for any mechanical issues. Bottom line: can't recommend this place highly enough."""Best Mechanic Shop Ever!"Pros: Brian has amazing customer service skills. He calls you once the car is opened up and then like a surgeon diagnosis the problem with honesty and some truth. What I mean is he says 'I believe with 96% probability that ____so_and_so_is_the_issue___  with your car. I really like the honesty and trust he conveys when discussing the diagnosis. Just like with humans, Doctors are unable to always predict with 100% certainty that a person has a specific disease and Brian says it how it is as well. It brings the conversation down to Earth and I haven't had that type of service at a mechanics shop especially in a large city. "After fixing the car he actually brings out the old part and explains everything they did to fix the car. He goes into detail in layman terms and it reassures you as the customer in the care and trust they take to fix your car. "Cons: Even for basic service it often takes +3 days to do.""""I just got back from getting my oil changed here. Brian, one of the new co-owners, could not have been nicer and more polite both on the phone and in person. I called a lot of places trying to make an appointment, and was turned down pretty rudely until I finally called Aamco and spoke to Brian. He got me in the next day (which everyone who works a 9-5 during the weekdays will be happy to hear was actually a Saturday--they're open Saturday mornings!) and I was in and out with little issue and reasonable prices. Brian was there to meet me when I got there, and also fixed a loose splash guard next to my front wheel free of charge. I will definitely be going to Aamco for my future car needs. ""P.S. If you're the type that doesn't really like just hanging out in the garage while you wait for them to finish with your car, Aamco is pretty conveniently located just off Baum, behind the AAA building, so you can leave, walk around, shop for some groceries across the street, or grab a coffee at Starbucks while you wait."""I've been going to see Larry at Aamco for years and was always pleased with the timing and results. Larry retired in December and now Brian is a co-owner with Jim. Both are incredibly nice and accommodating. Recently I had to get my annual inspection but was in the middle of getting a temp registration because I lost the original and was supposed to get it later that day. Brian said he'd be able to do everything except the emissions test and when I get the temp to bring it over and he'll finish it up. He could have easily told me to make another appointment when I have all the correct documentation but didn't."After I got them the temp registration and they finished the inspections, I thanked them and apologized for everything and Brian said, """"well we strongly believe that if you're good to your customers they'll be good right back to you."""" So this is my first yelp review, something which I never thought I'd participate in, but these guys deserve it."""Honest guys. Fixed me right up with a quick appt."I do not usually write reviews unless I am upset, but this Aamco is the exception.  I brought my car in for the state inspection after a bad experience at another shop.  The new owner was extremely accommodating, personable, and honest.  After an hour, he told me my car was fine and offered guidance on future maintenance my car would require, but did not try to push it on me as it was not necessary at the time.  I was in a hurry so I opted to decline, but this Aamco will definitely be getting the work when it is time for it, though.""This management team is stellar.  From reception to management there is always a friendly person available during business hours.  They pick up your mail when you're out of town and deliver UPS/FedEx packages during the day when you're not there to sign for it.  Any time there is a maintenance issue someone will come by the day of or next day and fix the problem, even if I'm not available to be there.""I had to move out recently due to a relocation to another city, and I wish I could find a company like Franklin West here.  They sent my security deposit refund quickly and set the bar really high for my future renting endeavors.""""Ed and Lynn are decent people with a fine revolving relationship with some excellent coaches and pros. They hold clinics and host leagues and have been a vital part of the winter tennis community. If it's raining or cold, or if you want to play doubles, this is the place to go. The courts play fast, they are relatively well heated and aerated and the lighting and upkeep has been better than good. Court fees are slightly high, but if you're an addict, it's worth it. Coach Dave Bender who runs clinics and classes there is especially good at his job.""Pittsburgh Indoor Tennis Club is a great business!  I went to the Monday night clinic with Pro David Bender and it was great.  Nice people, great drills, good mixture of skill, perfect way to ease back into the game!  They have more advanced clinics at well for those of you who can play.  The building is convenient if you live in Shadyside.  Did I mention the clinic is very reasonably priced?! A++"What would Pittsburgh do without Time Bomb. "It is the best store for urban clothing in all of Pittsburgh! Similar to Next in Cleveland and Standard in Atlanta. I have been copping from there for over 10 years! It it located in the Shadyside area of the city bordering East Liberty near Villa, David's Shoes and Ace Athletic. ""They offer tons of brands for men and women like Artful Dodger, Cold Chillin, Crooks & Castles, Dime Piece, Evisu, Five Four, G Shock, LRG, Married To The Mob, Play Clothes, Kid Robot, The Year Of and many more. They also carry both local and national mix tapes and also have artist's coming through the store to show love. ""If you're ever in Pittsburgh looking for some fresh gear and music make a trip to Time Bomb! Get ya life right! What up Brick?!""""TimeBomb is without a doubt the best spot in Pittsburgh to get all the exclusive Raw street merchandise. This is my favorite store in the city not only because of it's selection of merchandise, but for it's uniqueness. ""The owner Brick who started the store in '95 I believe is a great guy who always takes care of his loyal customers. I've received free apparel, stickers, DVDs, mixtapes, you name it from Brick. He's a man who knows how to keep his customers coming back! ""All in all TimeBomb is the place to shop in Pittsburgh if you're looking to """"Get Your Life Right""""""""My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh- I had great experiences with their Korean selections like Bi Bim Bop, Chicken Katsu, and Jum Bon. Must try! Great atmosphere, wonderful people, reasonable prices.""As the reviews of Casbah appear to be particularly long-winded ... the place is nice, fancy, organic-ish, alternating menu, nice atmosphere. Good date restaurant. Good food-lovers restaurant.""I went to Casbah for brunch, it's a $22 prix-fix, which includes an alcoholic bev, an appetizer and an entree. They use amazingly fresh and yummy fruits and veggies. I had the house made granola which was just amazing! Toasty and sweet, it was nothing like the granola you get out of a box. Also, while the food is totally fru-fru (in only the best way :) and it's a pricey brunch, you get a lot a food. After the great pastry basket, my appetizer, a Bellini and a cup of coffee, I had two bites of my omelette and took the rest in a doggy bag (""the rest"" included fruit salad, potatoes, and a croissant!)""My only complaint would be how long everything took. While I love a leisurely meal, an hour and a half for brunch seemed a bit excessive. I go into brunch groggy, then I have coffee and yummy food, and I'm totally amped, ready to face the day! And then I get to sit. And wait. Anyway, it's totally not a big deal, now I'll know to make time the next time I go. Which is for dinner for a friends birthday. So excited!!"""I was pleased to finally find a place in Pittsburgh that's worth it for me to spend some money. I tire of eating out only to become dissatisfied knowing I could have made the meal better myself. Not here."The food is made to order, seasonal, local, some organic...in short, they actually care about the quality of the food which is becoming a rare trait in restaurants today. I had made it a point to never eat fish in a Pittsburgh restaurant but Casbah changed my mind. The cod dish I had was delicious--not overcooked, breaded, too oily or too salty! ""Decor is subtle and great for a date. Service was friendly and accommodating.  I will most definitely return!""""Great great for parties and celebrations of all kinds.  The wait staff is extremely knowledgeable of the menu and the wine list.  The Food is creative and many of the items are organic or locally grown.  Everything is so fresh and pretty, you almost don't want to eat it.  The wine list is extensive, and although it can be pricey, they have great happy hour specials."This is my favorite Big Burrito restaurant and definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the country. "Gotta be honest, though. Just about every time I'd been here, it's with colleagues, which means lots and lots of boozing!! Therefore, consequently, as a result, in sum, I don't have a crystal clear memory of what I had for appetizer, entree, dessert, etc. ""What I can tell you is that I had never been disappointed with anything I've ordered here. And believe you me, if the food is not that good, I will remember it no matter how drunk I am. Sure, it's not exactly a """"Mediterranean"""" restaurant, but who cares? The food is great, it's in a super cute hood, the atmosphere is cozy and comfy, and the service is always spot on. ""I do recall that the very last time I ate here was with a dear friend and two of her British colleagues, and we had ourselves a grand ol' time. I had the arugula --one of my favorite words. It's lovely, no? Say it with me. A -ru-gu-la! Fun, right?!! And so flavorful!! --salad and cioppino, which was outstanding with super freshy fresh ingredients. What about dessert, you ask? Sorry, kids. By that time I really was drunk, and I can't remember. It was super tasty, though! I remember everyone liking mine the best. Sure do, sugar!""So pay no mind to others' taxonomy quip and give this place a whirl. It's a great date or small group place. Oh, and super fantastic wine list, too!""""Excellent place for brunch.  For $22, I had a mimosa; cheese, fruit, and baguette slices; a waffle with berries and whipped cream; two pieces of bacon; and a muffin, scone, and biscuit with honey butter from the bread basket.  Service was pretty good even though the restaurant was fairly busy.  Reservations available through Open Table.  This is definitely a special occasion brunch, but it is surprisingly affordable.""One of my all time favorite restaurants in Pgh, Casbah is still going strong 15 years later. Today's lunch was a wonderful mac and cheese with braised lamb; my dining companion enjoyed the corn risotto with shitake mushrooms and a side heirloom tomato salad. They use the best fresh local ingredients to craft some of the most delectable, interesting fresh food around.  Also great for Sunday brunch.  You won't be disappointed.""Excellent excellent brunch spot.  For review #100, a 5 star review for a 5 star restaurant is definitely fitting.""Casbah does brunch, lunch and dinner, but brunch is my favorite meal and also what they do best.  I ordered their prixe fixe brunch option which is a choice of an appetizer, brunch dish, and drink for $22.  I started off with smoked salmon and had the waitress recommended braised lamb and eggs as an entree and a mimosa to drink.  My companion ordered butternut squash & apple cider soup, wild mushroom omelet, and a glass of fresh orange juice.""While waiting for our food, we munched on their complimentary pastry basket consisting of super moist mini-muffins, scones, and super rich and buttery biscuits with honey butter.""The smoked salmon came with capers, minced red onion, crumbled egg, a drizzle of aioli, and a beautiful fried potato cake.  There was just the perfect amount of everything on the dish; the potato cake was just big enough to balance out the saltiness of the smoked salmon and the capers of course paired beautifully with the smoked salmon.  I tried some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty complex flavor.""My entree reminded me of an eggs benedict with a twist: grilled  sourdough topped with spinach, braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs.  I love braised meats because braising can do such wonders to tougher cuts.  The braised lamb shoulder was flavorful, tender, and super rich.  The best part about poached eggs is sopping up the extra yolk with bread and it just tasted better with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit.  This dish itself is enough to make me a regular.  I tried my companion's home fries which came with this slightly spicy ketchup (I think it's house-made) and also a piece of her omelet which was pretty good too.""Service was good, ambiance was good, portions were big, quality was excellent, AND they take reservations.  Sometimes I don't mind waiting the half hour it takes to get seats at some restaurants (Point Brugge, Coca Cafe, etc.), but most times I'd rather spend time with people in the restaurant at a table rather than waiting outside, especially now with winter approaching.""""Such a pleasure to dine, on my birthday, at a restaurant with such good food and cocktails right in Shadyside. We planned in advance to come here after I received Big Burrito's free-entree birthday voucher** and after  coming here to sample dessert and drinks. The food--short rib ravioli, lamb and polenta, pumpkin cake with ice cream and toffee--was insanely rich and tasty and decadent, perfect for a celebratory meal. Our server made some clutch drink recommendations too. My favorite: the local martini, all made with locally-sourced ingredients and ridiculously good chevre-stuffed olives. Almost like a cocktail and small plate in one.""After reading everyone else's reviews, I hope to come back here next for brunch.""**to take Big Burrito up on this offer, join their mailing list decently before your birthday, and a voucher will come in the mail! It was a blissful discovery for a pair of graduate students.""""I'm a big fan of all the Big Burrito restaurants I've tried (Eleven, Umi, Mad Mex & Casbah). I think Eleven is my favorite, but Casbah is a very close second. ""My most recent trip was with my wife on 1/15/10. We started with the grilled flat bread and the butternut squash ravioli. For entrees, I had the Casbah twice cut pork chop and my wife had a pasta dish with sausage and ricotta. For dessert, I had the creme brulee and my wife had the espresso ice cream / cookie (it was really just a fancy chipwich). ""The grilled flat bread came with three different dips, Humus, Red Pepper Hummus, and Baba Ganoush. I really enjoyed all three, but thought the Red Pepper Hummus stood out as the best, although if you're not a fan of garlic you may disagree. The butternut squash ravioli didn't impress me much, but my wife really liked it. ""As far as the entrees, we both really enjoyed our meals. My pork chop was cooked perfectly, and was anything but dry. The sage aioli that it was topped with added an excellent flavor. The sides were kale, and butternut squash risotto, both of which really shined. I can't describe how amazing the risotto was, and the kale was extremely flavorful. ""I tried my wife's pasta dish, and overall I thought it was good, but the sausage was really outstanding. Incredibly tender and flavorful. ""Neither of us were too impressed with our desserts. The creme brulee was very good, but at that point, I expected it to be great. My wife's dessert sort of disappointed, since the cookies were dry. ""The bill for everything listed above, plus a bottle of red wine (~$35) was $120 before tip, so it is pricey, but in my opinion totally worth it. ""Also, our server was very attentive and helpful, without being intrusive. I asked his opinion on the French Malbec and he gave me his honest opinion, which was negative."""One of my favorite restaurants in the world.  "Excellent atmosphere, fantastic food, great wine/drinks.  Menu changes up pretty regularly and I've never had a bad dish there.  The stuffed pork loin was one of my favorites.  Also they usually have a summer sangria (even in winter :) that is delicious. The scallops were also fantastic. The front patio/tent is open year round with heat lamps."Revision: I was just back at Casbah for a fundraising dinner.  Once a month they do a private dinner for a charity - for $100 there is a five course meal with wine flights.  All proceeds (not just the profits) go to the charity."My dinner was so good, I literally almost cried.  The wild mushroom risotto was bar far one of the the best things I've ever eaten in my life.  Short rib ravioli was my 3rd favorite thing I ate that evening, but I found myself dreaming of it the next morning!  I had low expectations for dessert - it was a cornbread cake (weird!) but came with a blueberry compote and cream cheese ice cream.  The cornbread cake was an excellent balance between the sweetness of the ice cream and blue berries.  It was amazing!""While I don't believe these are regular menu items, I highlight this because this was their charity dinner.  That they made NO money off of.  An area where they could skim on quality - but no - it was amazing.  Reaffirmed my belief that this is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh."""My fiance and I like to go to Casbah for special occasions and each time it never disappoints.  "The food is great (I highly recommend the Pork Chop and the Short Rib Ravioli), the drinks are wonderful (I am a sucker for good Sangria - and Casbah's is wonderufl) and the service is outstanding (our servers are always friendly, prompt and very knowledgeable).""""I had heard from friends that Casbah was one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh, and my experience definitely lived up to the hype.  I don't know how a place owned by a company called Big Burrito Group churns out such outstanding Mediterranean fare, but I was impressed.  Everything was done right--the ambiance was sophisticated yet unpretentious, service was professional, and the wine list was impressive, especially the by-the-glass options, which were necessary since I was dining solo.  The food (I started with grilled Spanish octopus and then had the halibut) was all fresh and prepared to perfection, with inventive flavoring that complimented rather than overwhelmed the dishes themselves.  I'm not in Pittsburgh often--too bad, it is a beautiful city--but I would visit Casbah again without hesitation.""Out of towners that happened to stumble upon this gem. Thanks, Siri. Wow! What a great experience. Fantastic, wine, food and service.""Ate lunch at Casbah for the first time. Tried the Piccolo Gusto: $15 gets you a small choice of salad, a half sandwich and a half portion of a pasta or risotto. Great deal and fantastic food. Argula salad, shodt rib sandwich and wild mishroom/truffle risotto. No need for dinner today!""Hard to remember another restaurant that hit home runs from start to finish.  Yinzes say it's pricey but I disagree, the quality is hard to find period.  Very progressive menu but not too wild, products are from near area farms, very knowledgable staff.  And butter served at the right temperature, that's a novel idea!  Just a great experience, can't wait to get back there.""casbah is the last big burrito restaurant i had left to try and i really liked it. i started with the sangria to drink which was delicious, and i'm usually not a huge fan of sweet drinks like that. we split the grilled flatbread app. the dips weren't anything super special, but the bread was thick and flavorful. no complaints. then we both got piccola gusta and split all our items. (the piccola gusta gives you salad or soup, half a sandwich, and half a pasta) between the two of us we had the tomato & basil bisque, arugula salad, crab cake sandwich, salumi sandwich, orecchiette pasta, and ricotta cavatelli.""i'm not a big fan of tomato soup, in fact, i never eat it, but i tried the bisque and loved it. it tasted more like a tomato sauce than soup. the arugula salad was great as well. the crab cake sandwich was really small but good, and the salumi sandwich was amazing... probably my favorite part of the meal. both pastas were good, but i personally preferred the orecchiette, the cranberries sealed the deal for me.""i love the atmosphere, we sat out on the covered patio, and the service was great as well.""i'll definitely be back again, hopefully to try the different brunch and dinner menus!""""Casbah is definitely my favorite restaurant in P-burgh; in fact, usually when I go somewhere else I wind up regretting that I didn't just go to Casbah. Every dish I've had has been excellent; some favorites are the sheep's milk gnudi, tuna tartare, arugala salad, bread pudding, and pretty much every soup. The short rib ravioli is a must have although arguably a touch salty. The menu is so inventive!""My wife and I go to Casbah every year for my birthday. It is my favorite of the Big  Burrito restaurants, and they have a birthday deal for $30 off an entree. ""This time I started with the Parsnip & Chestnut Soup, garnished with braised chicken, arugula & almond pesto. It was divine, with the rich sweetness for which parsnips are noted. My main course was Elysian Fields Farm Lamb Loin with flageolet beans, merguez sausage, turnips, greens and whole grain mustard. It was cooked perfectly pink, as ordered, and the flavors complemented each other.""For dessert, I skipped my usual chocolate - they offered Chocolate Mousse, Chocolate Cheesecake and Dark Chocolate Raspberry Bread Pudding. I decided to try the Pumpkin Bread with Butter Rum Sauce and Cream Cheese Ice Cream.  The cake was light and tasty and the ice cream and sauce were excellent.""""Brunch = best in the burgh.  Hands down.  Best. eggs. ever. I am not even sure how the eggs can be that good.  I know what you are saying, ""They are eggs, Jessica.  Get a grip.""  No.  I will not.  I cannot.  I want to stand on top of rooftops and shout my love for these eggs all over town.  ""J, H and I went there a few Sundays ago.  We all got the same thing. When was the last time you went to a meal and all three people ordered the same thing.  It was that good.  The scallop breakfast is out of this world.  2 perfectly cooked scallops, scrambled eggs (the eggs!!!), the creamiest, tastiest grits in the world, buttery croissant and sausage, apples and butternut squash.  Don't think those things go together?  They do and are awesome!  J and I also both got orders of bacon cause no brunch is complete without bacon.  ""Our service was also great.  Nice hostess, awesome waiter.  All was perfect.  "Really freaking good brunch.  Really.  Cannot say enough about those freaking eggs.  "Oh, but don't order an additional mimosa from the deal - they are $8 a piece which is a bit steep.""""Great menu - lots of choices. There were six of us and we shared 3 appetizers - the grilled chickpea hummus, the grilled octopus, and the mixed olives. The babagonoush hummus was delicious I had a winter fizz drink which was prosecco  with cranberry and mint nice flavor and perfect before dinner drink I had the cioppiano which was one of the best meals I have had in a long time. The sour dough bread was soooooo good. Most everyone else ordered pasta dishes and thought them very good. We opted not to have dessert there but they did bring salted Carmels to the table with the check so if they were any prediction of the desserts they are EXCELLENT. Great place to dine - I will return. And the complimentary valet parking was nice as well - didn't have to search for a place to park and the valet were super nice. I should mention our waitress was also super nice and very accomodating to our larger party.""The food here is amazing. I have to admit the price is a bit high, but it's just worth it. Beware though during dinner times, everyone there dresses up pretty formally. I am not talking about suits and ties, but you know what I mean so make sure you dress up appropriately!""My husband and I went to Casbah on our first date night after having our son. Our plan was to take our time and indulge in everything. After we looked through both the wine selection (outstanding) and the menu (delicious), we decided to do things a little differently. Instead of ordering just two entrees, we wanted to sample as many libations and treats as possible.""First, we ordered the white wine flight, and split a few seafood appetizers; then, we ordered the red wine flight, and split a few meaty appetizers; and, finally, we each ordered a glass of our favorite red and split a chocolate ravioli with raspberry sauce dessert. ""Our bill was quite pricey, but I feel totally worth it. Every single thing we drank and ate was delicate, perfect, satisfying, and well balanced. I would go back and spend the money any time!""""Brought my wife here for her birthday and we were lucky enough to arrive on the last of three nights of the truffle dinner. I saw it online before I arrived and dismissed it, but our server (Amanda) sold us on it when we got there. In fact, her thorough and enthusiastic descriptions of each course (including each cocktail and cheese) were a highlight of the meal. Sometimes over the top (""people say it's the best meal they have had in their life"" and ""the chef took this week off so he could enjoy the meal as a customer--and it brought a tear to his eye"") but we genuinely loved it. ""First, she made excellent suggestions on the cocktail (mimosa) and she helped us decide on the rest of the meal. Her recommendation to split the truffle dinner and add an appetizer was perfect. We left completely satisfied. ""The cheese was very good and the accoutrements well-paired. When I saw it on the plate, I didn't think it was very much but it ended up being the perfect amount. I also appreciated that they kept the bread coming, especially for the next course: a homemade pasta with pancetta, arugula and"""Oh I love this place.  It has a great menu and wine list.  It has all the great dishes with a touch of flare.  I took this meal to seafood town from start to finish and have no regrets.  The staff was really friendly - realized I was there for a special occasion and brought out a desert that said congratulations - the little things.We dined outside and I felt tucked away in a Europe-esque atmosphere for a few hours."It is worth reserving a spot on the patio to get the full experience."""Sunday brunched here. Food and service were excellent."Casbah has one of the most consistent kitchens in Pittsburgh. The menu only changes slightly from time to time, but it's always full of great options and the quality and preparation of the food is always top notch. The service doesn't disappoint either. I'm always amazed that they can nail it (food and service) every single time without fail. The bar area is a great place for drinks or dinner as well. Fiona behind the bar is always welcoming and fun and is perhaps one of the best bartenders in the city. It's also one of only a handful of good restaurants in the city that is open on Sundays. Now if only they would replace the swivel bar stools that are bolted to the ground and make it challenging for some (especially smaller women) to dine while sitting at the bar or for couples to sit as close to one another as they'd prefer."Very enjoyable menu n staff."I stopped by here this past Tuesday night for dinner by myself.  It had been a couple of years since I had last been to Casbah and while I remembered it being decent, it differed a bit from my fiance's opinion that this was the best of the Big Burrito restaurants.  Due to that it had been on my list of restaurants to visit so that I could get a better opinion of it.  The restaurant looked the same that I remembered it with a large outdoor seating area and a smaller one inside with the bar on one side of the restaurant and the dining room on the other.  It was all nicely and tastefully decorated.""I arrived shortly after 5 PM and immediately made my way into the bar area of the restaurant as I hate taking up a table if I am eating by myself.  There was no one else at the bar at this point and the bartender quickly greeted me and gave me a happy hour menu while explaining it to me.  I had not been planning on getting a drink but one of the $6 cocktails caught my eye and I ended up ordering it.  The bartender was pretty friendly guy and explained how he came up with the drink while he made the drink and we chatted for a bit.  For my entrÃ©e I decided to order the Long Island Duck which was a roasted breast, braised leg, gnocchi, spinach, rosemary, black mission figs and duck jus.  Whenever I had ordered it I had actually missed the fact that it came with a braised leg and was excited to see that extra unexpected portion of meat on my plate whenever it was delivered to me.  The whole meal ended up being incredibly tasty with the duck breast being cooked perfectly with nice seasoning and not greasy at all.  This was in stark contrast to the leg which was incredibly juicy and greasy which I absolutely loved.  Normally I am not a fan of greasier duck but the two preparations really helped to enhance the other.  Finally the figs provided a nice touch of sweetness while the gnocchi was pillow like and tasty.  It was also nice to be able to taste a hint of rosemary on them which I had forgotten about between the time I had ordered and when it was delivered.""The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future.  Both my cocktail and my meal were really good and I would actually consider this to be one of the best meals that I have eaten in a little while."""Love Casbah.  Been going there for years and have never had a less than great meal and service.  OF course their signature lamb is to die for (with the Stag's Leap Petite Syrah).  What can I say -- the cheese plate is great.  Everything is well-prepared and the service is among the best in the -burgh."My bf took me here on my birthday and it was so good he totally sealed ""the deal.""  ""This was on of the best dining experiences I've had in Pittsburgh...made even sweeter by the fact I left full, and without feeling the boyfriends wallet was just raped.  ""I had the Orichiette pasta and it was love in a bowl.  Savory and sweet and perfectly balanced.  Boyfriend had short rib ravioli and it was so good that when I asked him if I could have a taste he told me that he loved me, and he knew it was my birthday, and he let me have a bite, but he didn't want to share.  I didn't make him, I just know it was excellent."I have officially done dat all of the big burrito restaurants & I honestly feel like has bought is the most effortlessly sophisticated of all of them.  This is amazing food in a restaurant that is sophisticated without even trying."I really feel like has bought is highly underrated and you'd best get your arse over here to dying. They have a brunch which I hear is amazing and I can't wait to try it out."""Casbah is fast becoming my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I have been there twice now and both times the service and food was impeccable. "The calamari and the proscuitto appetizer are a great start to the meal and not too heavy or filling and I could eat a whole basket of the warm bread. I'd love to know where they get it from as I can't imagine they bake it there, but maybe they do! ""The pork chop is their signature dish and does not disappoint. My husband had the duck the last time we were there and it was juicy on the inside and had a great crispy skin. I had the red pepper casereccia and was thrilled with the amount of seafood in the dish. There were 4 HUGE, delicious scallops and a ton of lump crab. Very impressive. I was there with a group of 6 this time and everyone had clean plates at the end of the meal. ""I like the fact that it seems like the menu changes with the seasons. The proteins may stay static, but since they use a lot of local ingredients, the accompaniments/side dishes might be different every time you come. Honestly, this is one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. I plan on trying it for brunch or lunch sometime soon."""Awesome brunch!We have now made it a tradition to go to Casbah for Easter Brunch. The selection is fabulous and the portions are generous. My husband always gets the creamy polenta and raves about it. The lamb and eggs are perfectly cooked and the tomato bisque was divine. I could live on that soup. "We were disappointed to learn that they took the macaroons off the menu. They were my husband's favorite dessert. We didn't try any of the desserts this time because we were stuffed but I'm sure they're excellent!""""I enjoy coming to Casbah because it reminds me of the fresh, local elements I so enjoy about the Napa and Sonoma Valleys. Casbah gets a lot of produce and meats from local farms, and I love that!""I also love the cheese selections here. I usually ask my waiter to surprise me with any combination, and it's always fantastic. I am a sucker for the duck here. It's duck two ways-roasted breast and braised legs. Absolutely delicious. The gnocchi on the side is fantastic. I also like the double cut pork chop with the braised kale, as well as the roasted chicken because the polenta on the side is so yummy.""The wine list is pretty good, and the waiters are generally knowledgable about pairings, which is nice, because sometimes you just want to sit back, relax, and let someone else do the work."You can't go wrong with any of the pastas. It's sometimes fun to split a pasta as a starter. It's a nice way to try a variety of dishes. The orrechiette is a great choice because it combines the tartness of cranberries with the savory creaminess of goat cheese. Yum!"If you're not absolutely stuffed at this point, try the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding for dessert. You won't be disappointed!"""A taste of CA in PA.  We walked in and I would swear I was in Santa Monica or Hermosa  beach.  Great atmosphere- creative menu and delicious food.  The steak was to die for and the pumpkin cheesecake finished it off.  They also have a nice wine list.  The French Chardonnay was quite good!"Thanks for making me feel at home.""""My absolutely favorite dish is the potato gnocchi. Just amazing! Service is fantastic, nice decor. I wish they wouldn't use such huge paper towels in the bathroom, but other than that I really like this place."Casbah was such a great experience. I dined here with my boyfriend and 2 friends for my birthday. Drinks are fairly priced. They offer wine flights and champagne flights. The food was wonderful! "I started with a homemade chicken noodle soup. Didn't expect to see it on the menu here, but it was really good. My party got the tuna tartare, and 2 different olive dishes. Seeing the prices on the menu (all $22+ for entrees) I would have expected a $5 plate of olives to be about 5-6 olives. But it was a bowl full. And they were yummy. For entrees we had the duck breast, which according to my boyfriend is the best and most perfectly cooked duck he's ever had. I had a prosciutto plate, it was technically an app, but it's my birthday and I'll eat what I want! Another member had the cioppino, and she loved it. "We then got their birthday dessert which was a chocolate cake with ganache and brÃ»lÃ©e ice cream. It was great. "I couldn't have asked for a better birthday dinner!"""Great atmosphere and food experience.  What else can you ask for?  Went here 2 weeks ago for the first time and totally enjoyed it.  Pretty good wine list too!"The rave reviews I'd heard for Casbah were so over the top, I thought it would be impossible to live up to.   Casbah has exceeded it's sky high expectations and made me a believer!  We got the brunch and while the $24 pre-fix menu isn't cheap, it actually felt like a steal because the ambiance, decor, friendly attentive staff, and generous portions of delicious, inventive food were all so fantastic!  ""The brunch pre-fix included your choice of breakfast cocktails, appetizer, entree, and amazing still steaming home made muffins and mint chocolate scones.  I'm anything but a light eater, and there was so much that I still had to take half my meal home!""We all got different things and there wasn't a single bite of anything that we didn't love.  I particularly recommend the Arugula salad, salmon and dill appetizer, and the scallop and grits entree, though you really can't go wrong.  ""The decor and music was just as unique, artistic, and beautiful as the rest of the Big Burrito hot spots.  We ate in the basement, with a beautiful fully stocked glass wine cellar, under lit stone tile walls and wooden ceiling trim.  Casbah isn't cheap, but I'd still consider it once of the best values in the city  because you get so much for your money.  I'd trust Casbah to celebrate any special event with a flawless dining experience."""Dinner Saturday night was excellent. The server was on his game and the chef out did him/her-self."Drinks were perfect, food perfect for all four of us and again service was excellent.""""I recently realized that I had only given Casbah four stars after my first visit here for New Year's Eve 2012... What a terrible judgment call that was on my part. So I'm back to proclaim that over a year later - having dined here again in 2013 - with a year of dining experiences across the country -  I still regularly dream of this restaurant. Do I dare say it's my favorite restaurant? I'm not sure, but if it's not my favorite, it's certainly close.""We returned after NYE last year to celebrate my birthday in March, making sure to bring along the oh-so-coveted Big Burrito birthday coupon. I ordered the Orecchiette with Chicken, Cranberries, Goat Cheese & Sage Cream. Oh. My. Goodness. Don't order this if you're on a diet... but order this if you love delicious food and living life to the fullest. It was ridiculously creamy, and the cranberries packed the perfect fruity balance to the rich dish. My husband ordered the Double-Cut Pork Chop with Kale & Butternut Squash Risotto. While recently dining at a highly rated restaurant in NYC, he said, """"My double-cut pork chop at Casbah was better than this double-cut pork chop."""" That's when I knew that I needed to update my review of Casbah.""Finally, my delicious birthday dinner ended with the Dark Chocolate-Raspberry Bread Pudding. I love ordering bread pudding at restaurants, and I think this is the best of them all. I would confidently enter this dessert in a bread pudding competition, knowing that I would be walking away with the blue ribbon.""""My favorite local place in Shadyside.  My husband and I go for Friday HH (5-7 pm) every time we can.  Juan is great behind the bar, but Fiona and Joe (I think Joe, maybe his name is John?) are awesome as well.  The HH drinks change seasonally but you can always get your choice liquor mixed drinks also.  For $6/drink you can't beat it!""We typically always get the hummus trio as an appetizer with extra pita bread, or the calamari.  All of the entrees we have had (pork belly, risotto, pork chop) have been perfectly prepared, zero complaints.  It's on a pricey side, so not a weekly dinner option for us (unlike the HH!)""I would say the complimentary valet is a perk, but we live within walking distance so haven't used it.  ""TIP:  Go to HH on Fridays, ask for Juan, get a Manhattan.  Your QOL will improve greatly!""""This was an amazing brunch place! A family friend asked me grab brunch here because her son used to work here as a chef/cook. The food was divine! The brunch comes with a cocktail, an appetizer  and then your meal. The coffee was really good and the mimosas were strong. We sat outside on the patio and it was just beautiful. A perfect retreat from the snowy outside that morning. Definitely go!""This is such a fabulous place.  Regardless of the occasion the food and the service are impeccable.  In Pittsburgh trying to find a restaurant that will fit everyone in your parties needs is difficult - Casbah is the spot.  My family had a birthday party for me here on Sunday.  Casbah was accommodating with a cake, with a loud bunch that constantly changed their order, and were extremely patient.  The food was outstanding, as per usual! I ordered the Elysian lamb which was delicious! Cannot wait to return!""Thursday night January 30. Excellent service and excellent meal. Very crowded when we went. Glad we had reservations on open table. My wife had scallops, I had the signature pork chop. Both were perfect. We loved the octopus appetizer.""For a late lunch my wife and I shared the grilled flatbread, Scottish salmon, pastrami sandwich, and purÃ©ed pear and mushroom soup. Creme brÃ»lÃ©e after. All food was really good and the soup was a very different flavor for me. Service was great. This is part of the Big Burrito restaurant group, we are definitely going to try some of the ""We felt the prices were a bargain for all we got. $56""""We dined here for my wife's birthday last year. We started out at the bar ordering cocktails. I had a tasty cocktail with bourbon. We finished our drinks and made out way over to our table. We started out with a cheese tasting, which was very good. For entrees she ordered the Halibut and I had the Red Pepper Casereccia. This was seared sea scollops with a red pepper pasta. This entree made my list of favorite dish ever eaten. It was so delicious. I cannot wait to have it again!""We love this Big Burrito establishment as it matures and becomes a perennial choice to enjoy, no matter the season. It starts with a well-stocked bar area, nicely lit and very comfortable. The indoor dining area is complimented by the (now-covered) outdoor seating area. ""Service was mostly attentive, and very friendly throughout the evening. The wine list is varied and reasonably prices, with especially fine after dinner selections. ""We started with two appetizers this time out, the Tuna Tartare and the Sheep's Milk Gnudi. The tuna was very clean, served with nicely grilled sourdough. The Gnudi had a great truffle butter and tarragon flavored sauce. ""I also had my all-time favorite salad, the Arugula. This masterpiece features homemade pancetta, crimini mushrooms, and goat cheese. We split the Ricotta Cavatelli Pasta, prepared thoughtfully with fennel sausage and spinach. "Dessert was a nice assortment of house prepared sorbets (mixed berry/pineapple/grapefruit). "Valet parking is complimentary; please tip your driver!""""One year since my first venture to Casbah, I had the chance to return for a second time. And I have to say that I am officially a die-hard Casbah fan.""Yes, our dinner group quickly racked up a big bill - but it was for a birthday party, and Casbah had kindly sent along a $30 off dinner coupon beforehand. Even better, they went ahead and applied the discount even though we managed to forget to bring the actual card they had sent ahead to us. We had been completely prepared when asking about this to potentially not be able to use that $30 off at our visit, so their understanding alone would have gone a long way in making the meal a good one.""The amazing food just sealed the deal. Between a table of four we all had the chance to order and then a variety of Casbah's current menu - including their scallops, arugula salad, duck, pork and veal meatballs, and a ricotta very similar to what I had ordered the last time I visited. Everything was stupendously delicious - I honestly have no other words for how good this food was - and we all left full and satisfied with no complaints.""Casbah has definitely become a restaurant that I can come to for special events. Their food and service impressed me again tonight even more than they did last time; add in the fact that they use local ingredients whenever possible and always have something new to try with the changing seasons, and I'm completely sold. Here's to the next special occasion and dinner out at Casbah!"""I recommend the short rib ravioli! Totally the best thing I've had in a long time."Excellent prix fixe brunch with impressive service. One of the best brunch deals in Pittsburgh: two courses and a drink for under $30, and their selection has something for everyone.  I love their patio ambiance as well as their basement set-up. Great place to take visitors or for special occasions.""I'm a huge seafood person so the first time I ordered a Bloody Mary with the smoked salmon to start and sea scallop fry as my main.  I'm a fan of their Bloody, it's spicy and flavorful. The smoked salmon was filling enough that it's easy to split and the truffled potato cake served with it melts in your mouth. The sea scallop fry is everything you would expect, almost too much food, but no complaints.""My second trip to Casbah brunch, I went with my old favorite of the smoked salmon but split it with my friend who ordered the cheese plate. Also, I ordered the Braised Lamb & Eggs as my main based on friends' recommendations. It's honestly to die for. Rich and flavorful in the best way, attributed to the tarragon sauce and the slow roasted lamb, and easily their specialty. If you want to order something you can't get anywhere else, order this. It's very filling and rich, especially if you get a filling first course. Have only been here for brunch, and looking forward to trying their lunch/dinner!""""I have a soft spot for this place -- probably because it is one of the first restaurants my fiance ever took me to, and he made a special night out of it. We've been back many times, for many occasions, and Casbah has never disappointed. Great wine, cocktails, food, service, and atmosphere. It can be a little more cramped on the inside, but it's never too loud. If you can sit outside, it feels nice and spacious. It's also very nice downstairs.""The valet parking is a huge plus in my book, especially in that area of Shadyside. The service is always prompt and never overbearing. ""The last time we went, we had the sheep's milk gnudi and I'm pretty sure it was sent straight from heaven down on to our plate. I nearly fought my fiance for the last piece. He loves me so he let me have it. The swordfish was wonderful. The lamb is always great. The short rib ravioli melts in your mouth. I'd highly recommend any of those.""The dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding is worth unbuttoning your pants for...and if you like dessert wines, you'll be in heaven for sure!""""Started with the Cheese Plate then the Octopus then the Duck, finishing with the Chocolate S'More Cake. Great experience especially the service. Robert was spot on! I'll be dreaming about this in the future.""One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh! Very great food and even greater service. Ask for Robert, he is great! Ashley the bartender is also very nice! The food was amazing. I had the Duck it melted in my mouth. The short rib raviolis are also amazing. The muscle appetizer is a nice size for the price. You get about a pound of muscles for 12$. I will definitely be back. They make you feel special and welcomed.""Better than expected. Great service. Had muscles, red pepper pasta (forget the name) with scallops and lump crab, husband had duck. Everything was cooked perfectly.  ""Waiter said he lived in many parts of the country and this was the best duck he's ever had and he was right. Only downfall is I didn't save room for s'mores dessert!"""This place isn't in my price range but on special occasions the food is actually worth the extra money. I didn't know food could taste so good. :-)"Delicious Sunday brunch at $28 includes a cocktail, appetizer and entree. The food is super fresh, locally grown and they even had peach biscuits.""Best ""Babaganoush"" we've had since we visited Egypt.""The gaspacho soup was fantastic, and since my husband wouldn't share his short rib ravioli, I can only assume they were suburb also. ""The atmosphere was a tad basic, but it was also different and therefore interesting and enjoyable."""Best gnudi I have ever eaten!"Loved this place, the food is sublime, I even licked clean the small homemade butter that they serve with the bread. Definitely will try out this place again!"""The food here was absolute perfection; each bite was perfectly orchestrated to deliver optimal flavor and enjoyment. The service was also fantastic!"For my entree, I had the cioppino -- it may be one of the best that I've ever had. The bowl was filled with beautiful looking seafood: large shrimp, clams in their shells, mussels in their shells, a gorgeous piece of perfectly seasoned halibut, and enormous wonderfully cooked scallops. They knew how to cook each piece of seafood to showcase it well. And the charred sourdough served with the cioppino was the perfect complement to soak up all of the delicious, savory flavors of the broth without becoming a soggy mush! My grandfather had the halibut and loved it... Cleaned the plate!""I had heard rave reviews of the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, so we had to share one for dessert! My grandfather said it was incomparable to any bread pudding; it was a sweet, smooth, decadent indulgence that paired well with the house coffee.""And the complementary salted caramels presented with the check were also amazing! I definitely need to come back again to try more of the menu... I think only wonderful items could possibly come out of that kitchen!""""I took my boyfriend to Casbah at the end of September for his birthday. We were seated near the door for our reservation however it was a very warm night so it was nice to sit in an open air setting. Our server, her name has slipped my mind, was excellent. I am not a fan of red wines but my boyfriend is and it being his birthday, of course I said let's get a bottle of red. We explained to our server what white varietals I enjoy and she suggested a bottle (which has also slipped my mind being months ago that we were there)that was perfect-both of us enjoyed it. We started off with the papardelle. The rabbit was delicious and it was perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked-the flavors were amazing together! For entrees, my boyfriend ordered the duck and I ordered the short rib ravioli. His words to describe the duck were ""life changing"". I was only able to taste a small piece of his since he ate it so quickly, but I agree it was excellent. The short rib was so tender and juicy. I was concerned it would be overly salty and it was not. It was the best ravioli I have eaten hands down! For dessert, we ordered a cheese tasting. It was the perfect way to end our meal-with the cheese tasting and a glass of wine. I can't wait to go back to Casbah and sample some other items-I would have ordered the entire menu on our first visit if I could have!""Not sure what really needs to be added about this restaurant; it is very very good (my favorite in Pittsburgh) but by far not inexpensive. The best thing you can do, and I am not sure if it has been touched on in previous reviews, is join the Big Burrito group mailing list; you will receive a free coupon for an entrÃ©e around your birthday to be used within a certain time period...makes it a really good deal. Oh, their wine menu is ridiculously overpriced...call up to find out their current corking fee (I think around $15 bucks) and bring a better bottle at a better price than you are willing to spend there.""Ah, the Piccolo Gusto Menu for lunch. For $15 choose soup or salad, plus a half sandwich, plus a pasta. You are not limited to a few choices. It is really difficult to come up with a trio because it is all so good. The tomato soup is amazing, but that is just a start. The short rib ravioli is to die for. It is really hard to narrow it down .... Treat yourself to a sumptuous lunch in a beautiful restaurant with great service.  PS: you must have bread!""Let me say that my five stars are based primarily on the calamari appetizer ... it is SOOO good! The squid was very lightly battered and fried so briefly that it was tender and delicious. Seriously, it was one of the best I've eaten, and I've made it a point of sampling calamari. The entrees (short rib ravioli and cavatelli) were very good, too. As for the Carrot Cob for dessert, forget it. It only detracts from the otherwise wonderful meal.""Upon receipt of the much-coveted Big Burrito birthday voucher, I had to make the tough decision about which of their restaurants to visit.  I was torn between Casbah and Eleven, but upon perusing the menus, reading reviews, and giving the matter much thought, I settled on Casbah.  I knew I'd made a good decision when I invited some friends to join me, and they said that, based on their past experience, I'd made an excellent choice!""Our meal started off with a few slices of bread, which came with butter and a Greek yogurt spread.  The butter was good, but the yogurt spread was amazing, and both of them dressed up the bread very well.  We then ordered an appetizer of the bruschetta, which was not your normal bruschetta, but was delicious.  I'm not entirely sure of the ingredients, since what we received doesn't match the menu description posted on the website, but one notable thing about it was that it had some pomegranate seeds that gave it a subtle sweetness and juiciness, complementing the other savory ingredients.  For my entree, I ordered the orecchiette, a dish consisting of ear-shaped pasta tossed in a goat cheese and sage cream sauce, with chicken and dried cranberries.  Flavorwise, this was one of the most well-balanced dishes I've ever eaten, with the savory ingredients and sweet hints from the cranberries (which were actual cranberries, rather than craisins, as I'd imagined) melding together in perfect culinary harmony.  The pasta was also cooked to a perfect al dente firmness, which held up well in the microwave several days later when I ate the leftovers.  The cranberry-lime dry soda that I ordered to go with this entree complemented it very nicely, and was a great alternative to wine (while I was tempted, I didn't order any since my dining companions decided not to, due to having driven).""My two dining companions ordered the Scottish salmon and the gnocchi, respectively.  Based on the samples that they provided me, Casbah did a great job on these dishes, as well!  The salmon had a subtle saltiness that complemented the flavor nicely, without overpowering it.  My friend who ordered it had had it before at Casbah, but had since been to Scotland, and he said that it was very similar in quality and taste to the versions of this dish that he'd tried there.  The gnocchi was one of the most unique and varied dishes I've encountered, and, based on the two bites that I tried, brought the ingredients together in a medley of flavors and textures.  I think my friend who ordered it described it best by saying that every bite was a bit different, but that they were all delicious!  Although all of us tried bites of each other's dishes, we each liked our own choice best, so we chose well.""After our entrees, we decided to order dessert.  Although I was tempted by the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, since many reviewers speak highly of it, I decided to follow my instinct and get the chocolate-hazelnut bomba.  I'm so glad that I did, since this dessert was amazing!  If you like dark chocolatey, torte-like desserts or Nutella, this dessert is a must-try. Since I mentioned I was at Casbah for a birthday dinner, the dessert was served with """"Happy birthday"""" written on the plate in chocolate icing, which was a nice touch.  My dining partners ordered the creme brulee to split between themselves, which came topped with an apple compote.  Based on the bite that I tried, it was a good rendition of a brulee, but couldn't match the star power of the chocolate bomba.""We visited at 7:30pm last Sun., at the later end of their serving hours, but service from our waiter, Brian, was very good.  We were seated in the tent-like area in the front of the restaurant, which stayed surprisingly warm during most of our visit.  At one point before dessert, upon returning from the restroom, I noticed that it'd cooled off, but the manager came out to turn on the heating elements, and it warmed back up in less than 10 min.""In sum, if you're looking for a solid fine dining experience with innovative, delicious food, Casbah is a great choice.  The food was impressive in its quality, and the service was what I've come to expect at a higher-end restaurant.  I'd particularly recommend getting on the Big Burrito mailing list to receive a $30 birthday voucher and $10 off coupons for the holidays, and taking advantage of one of these occasions to try it.  I'm certain that you'll be as pleased with your experience there as me and my dining partners!"""Casbah continues to be my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant. High quality service and creative dishes. Sign up for mailers for Big Burrito special offers and birthday discount.  Must try:CalamariCheese plateShort Rib RavioliPork Chop"Watermelon Gin Fizz""""Great place for so many occasions. My husband took me on our first date here for a very intimate night out (I definitely was impressed).  He took me back for a surprise birthday party in their downstairs area. The food is always out of this world. I have said to my self on multiple occasions (while reading the menu) ""i'm not sure what some of these ingredients are but Casbah never disappoints"" and they never have!! I can't wait to live in Pittsburgh again, this is my first stop.""I don't know of any place that comes to close to the quality of Mediterranean food offered at Casbah.  They have a daily menu that combines unique ingredients into a great blend.  My favorites on their menu are their spinach casareccia (which I customize with tuna steak instead of chicken) and their gnocchi (in that order).  They are open to customizing their menu so if you want half and half of each dish, they are happy to do that for you.  That is a huge plus for me.  They are safely my favorite Big Burrito restaurant""I am a huge fan of almost all things Big Burrito and Casbah is no exception.  I have been to Casbah so many times over the years that the visits all meld together, but on this particularly occasion I had the arugula salad to begin with which was delicious and my friend had the butternut squash soup which she really enjoyed.  We both ordered the the Scottish Salmon which was so delicious and tender that it literally melted in my mouth.  The house-made pastas are always a great option if as is the duck or the lamb which I've had both on a few occasions.  Their wine list is always spectacular - on this visit I had a glass of the Riesling from Urban, Germany and my friend had a glass of Pinot Grigio from Lenotti, Italy.  We had no room for dessert on this visit, but any of their desserts that have the Meyer lemons is always a hit and I am a die-hard chocolate fan and I will forgo chocolate for one of their delicious meyer lemon dessert creations.  I haven't been to Casbah for brunch in quite some time, but after having gone to Eleven recently for brunch, I'm keen to try Casbah for brunch again soon.""This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh; I've never been disappointed after dining at Casbah! We received a gift card and enjoyed a fabulous dinner starting with the mussels appetizer in a tomato based sauce.  Yum!  And then I had lamb loin with sweet potatoes and brussel spouts and cherry sauce.  What a beautiful presentation and taste.  My husband had the pasta with scallops and crabmeat.  He was equally pleased with his dish. We really liked the wine selection too!  We had cappuccino for our dessert, and it was the perfect ending to the meal.  We'll definitely be back!""Casbah is one of my favorite spots for an after-work drink or a romantic meal. The lighting and decor are very calming and inviting. The menu is refined Mediterranean with some modern twists. The waitstaff is attentive, timely, and always takes care of my food allergies. I always order sea bass or some sort of fish here, because they sear it to perfection. The chef actually made up their own side for my dish because I was allergic to the one on the menu. I received delicious crispy potatoes and sauteed arugula. Fantastic touch! They have a great wine list, as well. I would recommend Casbah to pretty much anyone, but it is especially nice for a one-on-one meal or a drink at the bar.""This past Sunday my girlfriends and I decided we would do a post-Valentines brunch at Casbah, and it was just what we were looking for. They have a deal where you get a brunch cocktail, appetizer, and entree for only $28. This was a great deal in my opinion. The food was delicious. I had the smoked salmon appetizer and the sea scallop entree. The scallops were perfectly prepared, not chewy or gummy. They were accompanied with sweet potatoes and onions and usually sausage- I asked the waiter for no sausage as I'm not a meat eater. All in all a great experience and we will definitely be back!""My introduction as a youth (dating back AWAYS) to gourmet and class.  15 years later, still delivers the goods.  Cheers!""I like this place. It's 5 min walk from my home to Casbah and now we're finally here. The place looks really Greekish and I like the fake candle on the table :) Our waitress is really nice and friendly and seems to have a brightening personality, which is enjoyable. We ordered a bottle Project Paso and it goes perfectly well w the entree. For apps, we had sheep's milk gnudi. It is super tasty and I like the lobster and the lemon sauce together. We had the famous pork chop and the Long Island duck for entree. Both are really good. The duck has the fatty juicy leg separated from the thin nice part, which is really thoughtful and help boost the flavor. The pork is not bad either. But the texture of the meat is a little too dry for my liking. If not for the sauce and the braised kale, the dish would be disappointing. Then came out desserts: the vanilla bean creme brÃ»lÃ©e and the chocolate de creme. Omg I can't even find a word to describe how good they are! The creme brÃ»lÃ©e is so much better than the one I had in Joseph Temberllini. I am totally blown away by the rich taste of vanilla and eggs. The chocolate de creme is perfect, too. The texture is between ice creme and fudge, really nice and smooth. My friend said that she could have another two of this. In general, Casbah is a nice restaurant with great food and thoughtful service, 5 stars!""Fantastic dinner. Every or of the food and drink was exceptional --- made it worth the extra money you will spend here. Great for a special evening. Can be a bit noisy inside but again, the food overcomes all potential downfalls!""Had my first dinner there last evening.  Excellent service, very attentive and pleasant.The bread came warm with sea salt butter served and another spread both were delicious.  I ordered the lamb loin and it was outstanding.  Just the right portion size, the potatoes were beyond delicious.  I don't normally have desert but I ordered a chocolate raspberry bread pudding that was also wonderful.  I could only eat half so I took the rest home."Bar was very nice and seats comfortable and the atmosphere was casual too formal.  Nice warm environment.  "I'm new to the area and have found parking a challenge, but what city doesn't have that problem, but the Casbah has valet parking - nice.""""I've been to Casbah several times now and each dinner experience has been even better than the last. I have tried several pastas, seafood, and meat dishes and not a single one has ever disappointed.  The aspect of Casbah that I feel sets it apart from even the other Big Burrito restaurants is its quality of service.  They are extremely polite, knowledgeable, and hard-working!""Fantastic food, fresh locally sourced, great service. Had the gnoodi and it was to die for. Ramps, morels, English peas- omg! At the table we had the salmon, braised short rib ravioli and pappardelle - all fantastic. Would come back again if in the area!"Quick business trip to Pittsburgh. Thanks to you Yelp I found Casbah. Duck entree was to die for. Service is top quality. Highly recommended! Thanks Yelp! Thanks Casbah!"I signed up for my big burrito birthday coupon and knew Casbah was the place I wanted to go to use it! Being that it is a little out of my price range normally, I figured it was the best place to use my coupon and celebrate my birthday! Believe it or not, this was the 2nd Big Burrito restaurant that I have ever been to, Kaya being my first (and I only visited the Sunday prior to coming here on Friday). ""My boyfriend and I made reservations for 6:30 pm on a Friday. We only made them the night before and it wasn't a problem at all. When you arrive, there is complimentary valet parking- how awesome is that? We were sat on the covered patio area, which I really loved. It was a little slanted, which was weird, but our table wasn't thankfully. It was really beautiful- plants and art all around. We started off with drinks- I ordered the white wine flight. Having had a wine flight one other time, I found these to be pretty reasonably priced. I received three small glasses of white wine for $11. Each one was delicious and I really loved how they were all from different places (Austria, Italy and Spain). ""Next, we received bread and two types of butter. One was more traditional and the other was a homemade lemon and herb butter. I really liked them both! For my entrÃ©e, I ordered the pork chop. It came with a magical mix of sauces and two side dishes- one that was mainly potatoes and the other being sautÃ©ed kale. WOW. The garlic cream sauce was unbelievable, the pork chop was HUGE and literally cooked to perfection. The kale was perfect, not bitter at ALL (how do they do that?)- it was amazing. The portion was huge and I somehow engulfed the entire thing. My boyfriend ordered the short rib ravioli's and loved it- although he preferred my meal over his. I was so full that I skipped the desert. They noticed my birthday coupon and presented me with an adorable little plate with """"Happy Birthday"""" written in chocolate and two salted caramels- what an adorable touch! ""Service was perfect, the wine was perfect, the food was perfect... now I see what the fuss is all about. This might be one of my new """"special occasion"""" spots-  and we are planning to come back next month for my boyfriend's birthday (I need that pork chop in my life again, stat!).""""You can't go wrong with Casbah. Meals and service are deliciously consistent, yet there's enough experimentation to keep things interesting. My dad and I visited this week, specifically, for Pastafest and - as usual - the meal was nothing short of spectacular. "We began at the bar where I mentioned a favorite drink no longer on the menu: the Malbec margarita. The bartender was quick to dig out the recipe box and whip one up to sweet and sour perfection. Happy hour prices make a stop at this bar one Shadyside's best options for higher end post-work cocktails. "Seated in the bright (though slightly stuffy patio), we began with Casbah's exceptional calamari. Lightly breaded and fried, the squid was tender and deliciously sauced with a garlicky aioli and the sweet and sour Italian agrodolce (ahhhmazzzing), the combination made for a crave-worthy bite. "Pastafest provided tasting portions of some old favorites and chef's creations. We shared three: "Gemelli, jumbo lump crab, sweet corn, guanciale, tarragon: sweet and bright, this dish was summer on a plate.  ""Doppio Ravioli, eggplant puree, goat cheese, sweet & spicy peppers, marinated fennel: creamy and rich, the sweet and spicy pepper sauce was just the acidic kick the ravoli needed to balance perfectly.  ""Sheep's Milk Gnudi, pork ragÃ´ut, baby kale, grilled scallions, orange sea salt, extra virgin olive oil: gnudi is an all-time favorite and the pork ragout was incredibly tender, a gussied up version of BBQ and pasta salad.""We ended our meal with the milk cake which was moist and sweet and lovely with the last few sips of wine. The thing about Casbah? I always leave wanting more, which always keeps me coming back.""""My husband and I love Casbah. We had our first date here, he proposed here, we had our first anniversary dinner at Casbah not to mention numerous brunches and dinners over the last 5 or so years. We are big fans of all the Big Burrito restaurants, but we have been especially pleased with the service and food at Casbah. Since they added valet service, that's one more thing you don't have to worry about. Very good portions sizes, well prepared food, and let me emphasize again- phenomenal service. Use your birthday coupon or have your special night out here!""My boyfriend recently received very exciting news and wanted to go out on the town to celebrate it. My last experience at Casbah was excellent (minus the dining partner but that's another story) so I suggested dining there for this occasion and, since he is not from the area, he trusted my judgment (and my Yelp elite status lol) to choose a great restaurant. I actually made reservations for 8:15pm this past Saturday while I was on the way back from my vacation. Personally, I was quite surprised there was still same day dining availability, but of course I didn't question it. We arrived right on time and used the complimentary valet (get your ticket validated before exiting the restaurant) which was great, particularly since it was raining. We were seated inside and normally I would have rather dined outside but due to the rain, I actually appreciated the inside spot. ""I began with a glass of Malbec (my new favorite go-to wine) and my bf had a Cab. We were brought bread which came with regular butter and another seasoned spread which was more flavorful. The bread was fresh and warm, much appreciated since we were both famished. We started off with a cheese tasting and chose the Jasper Hill """"Harbison""""; Vermont, cow's milk, soft; the Sardinia """"Calcagno""""; Italy, sheep's milk, hard; and the Misty Creek Goat Dairy Leon """"Leonora""""; Spain, goat's milk, soft. The tasting was accompanied by bread (I believe the same we were first served upon sitting down) and three spreads-a mustard, a fig spread, and an additional sweet spread, pinkish in color-possibly pomegranite spread. We both LOVED the tasting and all of the cheeses paired excellently with our red wine! We easily cleared the cheese board. For entrees, my bf had the Ricotta Cavatelli( house-made fennel sausage, spinach, crushed tomatoes, ricotta) and I had the Orecchiette (grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream). He devoured his pasta, however, I was able to sneak a small bite for it was entirely consumed and it was quite tasty! The sausage had a bit of spice to it that was very flavorful. I absolutely loved the orecchiette! The savoriness of the goat cheese compounded with the sweet tartness of the cranberries was heaven in my mouth! The chicken itself was quite flavorful and the pasta was cooked perfectly, not too firm yet not too soft. Another testament to the greatness of this dish is that my leftovers, heated in the microwave the following day, tasted just as good as the meal did when dining at Casbah! Unfortunately, we were stuffed to the brim and too full for dessert, which will be on the agenda for our next dining experience here. The only criticism I had this go-around was the service. We had a male server who was just not personable, unlike the last time I dined here and the server hit the ball out of the park with her friendliness, multiple suggestions and explanations, and knowledge of the menu. This server never introduced himself, mumbled and talked so quietly it was difficult to hear him, and rarely checked on us. My wine glass sat empty for quite some time before he came around and I had to ask him for a glass as he didn't offer if I'd like another. The main reason for dining out is the food, which was incredibly delicious so I will return, however, I hope next visit the service can match or exceed that of my first visit here since that exceptional service contributed to my wanting to return here again and this particular service made me feel quite undervalued as a customer.""""Amazing. My family and an out of town family (super foodies/winos) ate here once and ended up spending over 3 hours at our table, not because service was slow, just because it was a nice environment to chat away an entire evening. "We had tuna tartare that was amazing. I had halibut for my main dish that was incredible. I didn't pay so I'm not sure what the bill ended up being but I'm sure it dented someone's wallet. While waiting for our entire party to show up we hung around the bar which was very swanky but not in an overly fancy way. "Service was perfect. Would love to go back.""""Lovely place for delicious Mediterranean food and fine service. We went here for a friend's birthday and Casbah was a festive environment. This place is fine dining but it's not stuffy. I tried to keep my fork and knife and the server made jokes about how that's not their style. In addition, the patio is a nice romantic backdrop with overhanging lights and white curtains.""First let me talk about the drinks. My husband's moscow mule was a little stronger than most places would make it, but they do have the copper mugs. Some places cheap out on that but not Casbah. I had a delicious house Malbec but then switched over to a Grenache and Carignan blend. It was the first time I've had such a mix and I was so happy with my choice that I ended up ordering another glass. It was a wonderfully rich and bold (but not bitter) combination that was a superb pairing to our dinner entrees.""For starters I had the octopus, which was ok but not great. There was too much of a char flavor so it was almost burnt. The tuna however was an explosion of flavor. It was fresh and very flavorful.""For my main dish, I had the duck. I double checked with the waitress when I ordered to make sure the skin was crispy and it was indeed. The meat was perfectly tender and the sauce was sweet and savory."Everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed their meals. The lamb shank is so large you need to get a takeaway bag. "The birthday boy's wife arranged for an ice cream before we got to dinner. The waitress seamlessly distracted us with dessert menus while she got the cake ready, so she really added to the birthday fun.""All in all, this place really impressed. It can be  fun, romantic or celebratory depending on the occasion."""Nice outdoor patio dining area.  Short rib ravioli was great.  The halibut was also very good."I believe it was Aristotle who once said, ""Holy craaaaaaaaaaaaap!"" Based on the dining experience I had last night, I can only assume that he'd just eaten at Casbah when he said that.""Pittsburgh is a city that has no shortage of *amazing* restaurants and among those, Casbah is one of the best.""I went with my two kids (foodies at heart and who are both up for anything, always--no chicken nuggets for these two) and our experience, from the moment we crossed the threshold til we floated out after we were finished, was damned close to perfection. ""First off, THE WINE LIST. Sweet niblets. I had a glass of Michel-Schlumberger Pinot Noir that was so good that my eyes actually crossed. CRAZY good. And the rest of the selection was just as impressive. "We were served a basket of hot-from-the-oven bread with sea-salted butter and this otherworldly strained Greek yogurt stuff with lemon that was so yummy I seriously considered licking the plate. Seemed reasonable at the time. "Appetizers were flatbread with hummus, baba ghanouj, and red pepper muhummara (sublime) and veal/pork meatballs with crispy Brussels sprouts that earned a resounding """"OMG!"""" from the young uns.""The girl child ate--and swooned over--short rib ravioli, the boy devoured (and waxed rhapsodic over) his orecchiette with Elysian Farms chicken, and I lost myself in (and have pledged my troth to) the best cioppino I've ever eaten (San Francisco, eat your heart out)."But wait! There's more!"Dessert. Holy yum balls. Kid #1 had raspberry-chocolate bread pudding with crÃªme Anglaise, Kid #2 had the chocolate cheeesecake bombe. Both kids were over the moon and doing things like pledging to clean their rooms every day (that must've been SOME dessert). ""On top of all this, the service was AH-mazing. Every person who came to the table was funny and smiling and bending over backward to make the meal all it should have been. And it was.""I've eaten at a great many of this city's best restaurants and this was one of the best experiences I've had here."""Oh So Good!!! Greeted warmly and taken timely. (Had Reservations) Arrived early and had drinks. One Grapefruit Juice and One Natrona Ginger Beer.  Both my favorites. The beginning of a really nice dinning experience. "The menu was simple and eloquent. The low lighting made it hard to read but, the waitress explained everything. Nothing pretentious just simple on point.  The waitress stuck around for questions and returned with a table candle without being prodded. That was nice "I had a warm arugula salad. Very good!!!  Nicely dressed hints of bacon tossed in with greens. "For dinner; Date had swordfish, I had the pork-chop. Great choices. I have to say the RISOTTO, probably the BEST, and the sauces built up each bite beautifully. "Great Dinner Date."Recommend!!!!"""Casbah is my absolute favorite restaurant!! I love the sort rib ravioli. The beet salad is terrific and the rasberry bread pudding is to die for! The valet service is a nice touch so you don't have to worry about parking!! One of the times I am going to make it to the brunch!!I lived with this company last year and wanted to take time to write a review because I have found that when people have a good experience they're less likely to take time to review. I liked the people in the office because they were straight forward and to the point. Sherry even saved me from getting a parking ticket while viewing a property by running out to my car and telling them I wasn't from town and didn't know about parking near stop signs. "They put in all new carpets for me before my move in as well as new blinds which was great. The apartment itself was really cute and had cool features about it, including three closets. They paid all utilities other than electric which was pretty cheap for me. Rent was really reasonable for the great location. "My neighbor had two barking dogs that HOWLED and as soon as I told the office about it the howling was gone in 2 days (the guy bought bark collars). The battery in the smoke detector in the hallway ran out of batteries and started beeping which was also fixed within the day I reported it. I really do like the company and the straightforwardness of the staff. "Best of luck in your search.""""In September of last year, 2014, I had been struggling to locate a comfortable, beautiful, safe, and affordable one bedroom apartment in the Shadyside area. Anyone who is anyone understands that with much of Shadyside and it's surrounding areas, finding something with all four criteria is more than tough.""Luckily, while driving around searching for """"for rent"""" signs, I stumbled onto 415 S. Aiken Ave. This 7 unit building is very unique. With two apartments with balconies on the top floor, exposed brick in some, and brand new renovations in others, there is so much to love about the place I had spent my last year. Rent was more than affordable, and gas and water are included in the rent. Electric bills are barely relevant at 30-50$ per month. Plenty of space for one person, and a giant closet for storage (seriously, it's huge!). Yard and building is very nicely maintained, a lot for parking out back is just enough space, and the neighbors and their puppies keep mostly to themselves, but are all very very kind!""Now in regards to the company: Herbert Halsband properties has been nothing but kind, courteous, and respectful since day one. I've had quite a bit of interaction with the folks in the leasing office, as well as with the maintenance crew at my building. First and foremost, when I first accepted this apartment, it needed gutted and renovated. The staff that is hired by the company to remodel and perform maintenance on the buildings are WONDERFUL people, with lots of respect and a sense of humor to boot. Secondly, Sherry, Melita, as well as the rest of the staff over in the leasing office on Shady Ave, were such a pleasure through my entire lease. They understood and answered any questions or concerns that came up throughout the process (although concerns were few and far between). Not to mention, every conversation I've had with Sherry or Melita (the folks I speak with most often) has been such a joy... I truly couldn't have asked for a more overall perfect experience for my first apartment. ""I would whole heartedly recommend looking into the options that Herbert Halsband Properties has to offer. Give Sherry or Melita a ring at the office if you're searching, and I'm sure they'll find you something wonderful.""""Pros: Vegan food in Pittsburgh?  YES!  great music, friendly accommodating service, huge variety of drinks, fabulous decor""Cons: Not a convenient location for the car-less me, but well that's just me""Hi, I am a non-drinker and rarely have I found an establishment with an extensive list of non-alcoholic drinks.  Granted, Quiet Storm like many Pittsburgh places doesn't have an alcohol license and has to make do.  Ginger lemonade?  Yes.  All these other things from the soda fountain that are adult like enough for me?  Yeah!""I do love my meat, but found the vegan food here pretty good (albeit dry but I attribute that to my love of meaty things).  They used to have a prixe fixe meal on the weekends, but I think they got rid of that due to a low turnout.  Too bad most of Pittsburgh doesn't really learn to love culture.""Usually good music acts here.  Although the few times I was here, there was barely anybody else there besides the group I dragged along and the band's friends.  Usually 2-3 acts play.  Live.  And it's nice that there aren't many of us because we can sit up close.  And be sure to kick the friend who thinks it's ok to talk over the music.  "The bathroom also has a decor to match the style of the coffeehouse."I have never been here during the daytime so I can't comment on that.  Always great service when we came here for dinner and the music (since we were basically the only ones there).  Sometimes a minimal cover for the music.  There are books and comfy couches for the daytime coffee drinkers.""""I used to live about four blocks from the Quiet Storm, and for a period breakfast here was an every day affair.  Those two facts have nothing to do with each other--the period in question was close to the end of the first semester of my (super-)senior year, when my friends and I would stay in our studios all night working, haul ass out to Quiet Storm for ambrosia-caliber restorative tofu scramble and coffee, and go back to school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for another day of class.  And then usually I'd take a three-hour nap after the first class.  But I'm sorry, what is it I'm reviewing here?""The Quiet Storm has absolutely the best tofu scramble I've ever had.  I'm an accomplished vegan eater (I get stuff in my mouth first try nine times out of ten), I've had the best scrambles New York and San Francisco have to offer.  Believe you me, Quiet Storm tops them all.  I wish I knew their secret recipe, but the part I do know--baking the tofu rather than just sauteeing it--makes a tremendous difference.  Come in on a lazy Sunday morning, get the Nothin' Fancy, and you will see for yourself just how good tofu can be.  On top of that, they are as vegan-friendly as can be, with earth balance for the toast; soy, rice, and almond milks; and a selection of specifically vegan mixed drinks and milkshakes.  Plus, sandwiches!  Get the spicy spinach and peanut butter wrap, ask for added tofu (planks not crumble), and be astonished yet again.""AND AND, as a delicious cherry on top, they have theme brunches, fantastic theme brunches that show off the creativity and chops of the cooks here in a way that the regular menu can only hint at.  Check out their website and see when the next theme brunch is, and make a point of going.  Get there early.""""It's all about the Black & Gold. (Only on the brunch menu now, though!)"And the Tofu Tenders.And the vegan baked goods from My Goodies."My only complaint is regarding the vegan milkshakes. Sorbet does not a milkshake make.""""I looove Quiet Storm! It's a pain for the car less (me) to get to, and the service is fairly lacking, it's cash only with no convenient ATM's around, the closest business is a McDonald's half a mile away. And I still go there every chance I get. ""Hipsters abound (pro or con, depending on who you are) and the place is REALLY child friendly (again, could be a pro or con). But generally, the crowd is mellow, reading, chatting, just enjoying.""The menu is designed in a way that they have something for everyone (except those adverse to eating healthy :). Between the veg and vegan options, they manage to have a menu that is fairly celiac friendly too, not an easy thing to do!""A lot of the reviews here are about breakfast, which is amazing. But my favorite are their dinner salads. They're protein heavy, with a huge variety of ingredients, not your typical salads. And their specials, like tofu curry, are amazing, and always enough food for two.""Oh, and the drink menu! I'm pretty much a water, coffee, beer kind of person, so I haven't tried too much on it. But everything looks amazing. Quiet Storm is one of those places that doesn't do a wide variety of things, but what they do, they do damn well!""""I'm not sure how it took my wife & I so long to find this place! Before visiting the Quiet Storm I didn't realize that their entire menu was vegetarian, but that shouldn't be much of a problem even for fans of meat. I ordered the ""Maelstrom"" which is a what I would call a Mediterranean Quesadilla. The flavor was subtle, but delicious. There were plenty of menu options and it looks like this restaurant is really doing it's part to support the local community. The only complaint I would have was that the temperature also got a bit cold as we were sitting by the door... and it was winter. Finally, remember to bring enough cash to cover the bill as that's the only way to pay. I was not disappointed by the Quiet Storm and will definitely be getting back to this place next time I'm in Pittsburgh.""This is probably one of the most solid restaurants we have on Pittsburgh's east end.  It is also a haven for the vegan/vegetarian hipster.  I've been a handful of times now and only once did I get food I wasn't happy with.  Prices are reasonable, maybe like $1-2 more for food than you would expect to pay.  Keeping this place open is well worth that cost.""If you aren't feeling so hungry, this doubles as a coffee shop (lacks some coffee shop seating) and the hot drinks are solid.  Check out the milkshakes!""""CASH ONLY!!!  What a pleasant surprise!  I went here for the first time last night and wasn't sure what to expect when i walked in.  The place seems to have some spacial issues.  There was a bar but they don't serve alcohol, more of a coffee/diner bar.  The tables and chairs seem odd and it took me a while to find a chair that was comfortable, but maybe this is by design.  I am not a coffee expert but i really enjoyed my several cups of decaf.  Anyhoo, to the food.  This place is vegetarian only.   I started with a Hummus plate, unlike most creamy hummuses this hummus was gritty as i could actually taste the chick peas with each bite.  The hummus was surrounded by fresh crisp cucumbers, carrots, celery, calamata olives (big fan) and pita. Perfect starter.  For my main entree i ordered the curry special.  Do not expect an Indian food experience but this will not disappoint.   Everything was in the bowl, chick peas, basmanti rice, carrots, and other miscellaneous items.  Once i started dipping my pita into it I could not stop.  It was savory, spicy and just the perfect compliment to the cold snowy night.    This is one storm i will enjoy braving from time to time.""Quiet Storm was the other bookend to my trip to Pittsburgh, providing a perfect balance with Zenith earlier in the week. It's a little out of the way, but once we got there, it's exactly the kind of place I want to live close to. It's spacious and relaxed; we sat there for two hours after eating our lunch and were not at all pressured to move on. It had a very good neighborhood vibe, and everyone working there knew the place and the area really well.""The drink options were pretty great- the coffee was just fine, but the ginger lemonade I ordered a couple hours after lunch was phenomenal. I wish I could have that more often. The food was great; there are lots of options and the portion sizes were exactly what I wanted. I had the Dagwood sandwich, which was a perfect mix of sweet, sour, and spicy with hummus, apples, hot peppers, cucumbers, and pickles... it came with an option of the side, and I had to try the mockamole. A big fan of guacamole myself, I was totally in doubt of a green pea-based mock version. I also really like peas, though, so I was open. And somehow they managed to make it work, and it really did taste very much like guac, with a slightly less heavy and maybe a bit grainier texture. But definitely worth a try. My friend had a wrap with curry and tofu and I honestly don't remember what else, but it was huge and really tasty. She chose the potato salad as her side, and it was the perfect imitation of German potato salad, so I was pretty happy. ""All in all, if you're in Pittsburgh and feel a little lost... go to Zenith and Quiet Storm, and you will feel found.""""Fun, unique atmosphere (hippie / indy / hipster / whatever these kids are calling it these days). Interesting, tasty food. Above all, awesome retro decor. A Pittsburgh treasure.""I was really impressed by this place. I will first start with the service: The waiter was very friendly and it took me awhile to go over the menu since I've never been there. He was patient and stated ""take your time, no hurry"". He offered me suggestions. We even discussed shoes for a brief minute, very personable. The food: The menu was quite extensive...hoagies, soups, pasta, salads, etc. They also have stuff for kids like grilled cheese. I ended up ordering the lentil loaf with steamed vegetables and smashed potatoes. The food came out QUICK, like 5 minutes and everything was fresh and great. Did I mention this also came with soup? I paid $13 total for my meal and a cold chai. Could not ask for more. My only and I mean only complaint is that they only serve lunch at lunch time, the only serve dinner at dinner time, etc..so be mindful of the time of day you go....""I love you, Quiet Storm!!  Please open another location in the Los Angeles area, stat.  I think the best part about Quiet Storm was rolling in at 10:30 on a Sunday and being seated without a wait.  Are you kidding me?  That's AMAZING!  I was prepared to have to wait for a little bit for Sunday brunch. ""Quiet Storm has quite possibly the most delicious scrambled tofu that I have ever had.  I have no idea what they do to get the tofu to that texture, but its delightful and don't ever change.  I love animal products, but I did not miss the meat in any of the dishes that I sampled.  ""I order the Black & Gold breakfast burrito, which was delicious but not half as excited at the Country Gravy burrito my friend had.  The onion gravy is insanely flavorful and made me question why I put animal in my gravy to begin with.  I know, its a crazy thought but its true.  ""I look forward to many additional trips during my extended stay in Pittsburgh."""This space is so beautiful."i'm always a sucker for big windows all across the front, but here especially the huge windows and wide building front really opens up the space and provides excellent lighting for the front half of the cafe.""The layout is unique, with the island, counter, and bar stools in the center and plenty of tables all around. It really provides a lot of opportunities for unique corners to sit in alone and lots of space for groups.""The coffee is decent. It's made from Dean's Beans, decent fair-trade coffee and brewed to a consistent perfection. i can't speak to lattes and espressos because i've never tried them, even though QS supposedly just got in a new espresso machine.""The food is so-so, decent vegetarian fare, with the exception of most of the tofu dishes, which are spectacular.""And the milkshakes are always a good time, even if they're a bit on the expensive side."Cash-only if total is under $10."Contrary to what some others have said, this isn't a hipster hangout. The customers seem to be a nice mix between students, locals, and artists. This isn't an art museum--it's a vegetarian cafe that makes food and drink.""And it does a pretty fucking good job of it."""Very few people name the places depending on how the place is going to look like from the City's perspective.Confused??"I bet half of Pittsburgh students didn't notice this amazing vegan place,it is like a quiet storm ;just there but not really.Now i am confused!! :)"  Straight to the point -this place is huge and neat and they have a huge cafe bar with great food list.i ordered thai salad with vegan chicken and tempeh and my friends ordered wraps.It was simply delicious and i was extremely excited that i discovered this place after a long Vegan research." The place was definitely quiet and shockingly even the area around the place was dead.Maybe they have some historical reasons to name it Quiet storm like there was a light storm and everyone left the place...ahmm..I shall stop my list of lame reasons,such that you could stop reading and would be able to chase the quiet storm :)""-Smriti"""Stopped in as I was driving through Pittsburgh. Had an awesome bagel sandwich and some tasty vegan pastries. Very cute atmosphere. Totally sold me on Pittsburgh.I've been going here very regularly since 2002 and they've been getting better and better.   It evolved from a coffee house & music space to a straight up restaurant.    They catered my wedding and my yinzer family liked it despite there being no meat."For me, this was an especially warm experience. I arrived in Pittsburgh and came straight from the airport. The coffee was perfect, the company was even better. I ordered the home-fries with tofu and cheese. They were extraordinary. The tunes being dj'd by the barista didn't hurt either. I definitely dig this place!""ahaha!  i ordered a bowl of mac n cheese thinking, ""it'll be a nice side dish.""  little did i know that it would be a BOWL of mac n cheese.  and it was so good i had to eat it all.  ugh.  food baby."graham street tofu is the bomb.and the 5th star is for the pinball machine in the back."awesome.""""The Quiet Storm is one of the coolest places in Pittsburgh. Not only for food, but for the atmosphere and milkshakes!  If you are looking for a place to bring your parents, in-laws, uptight but good-hearted neighbors -don't let the hipster decor and server fashions lead you to think it will be a shouting match over noise music and avoiding awkward half-nude paintings, the food is genuinely delicious and the space objectively interesting.""I recommend the grilled cheese with apple and cream cheese, although both times I've gotten it it's been a little heavy on the cream cheese so if you are conscious about that kind of thing, ask for light cream cheese. I also absolutely love the buffalo tofu tenders, bread sticks, and the mac n' cheese. ""Also don't forget about their extensive and interesting drink menu! Lavender lemonade, root beer and espresso? Sounds delicious to me, and makes me wonder when The Quiet Storm will be getting a liquor license...the answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind..."""I wish we lived closer to this place. They had the most amazing French toast (stuffed with apple butter and cream cheese) I've ever had.Seriously. This place is PHENOMENAL. "I've never gotten something I didn't like. I'm a vegan and my favorite thing about this place is that it's not what most people would typically think of as veg. food. It's comfort food at its best...big yummy burritos...scrambles...drool inducing drink selection. Its got a really cool vibe and the prices aren't bad. Only complaint (if any) is that several of the servers seem a little zonked out...like they don't really give a shit. But whatever, go there...NOW!""""After three trips to Quiet Storm I am hooked.   I had the Bahn Mi, then the Veggie Gyro, then a burrito.  All were a large portion with excellent fresh ingredients at a price that was really really great.  ""My significant other is addicted to the chili, which actually has a good heat level.  "Also the milkshakes are to die for.  Can't get enough of them.Service is prompt and attentive.  The waitstaff is knowledgeable and friendly.  Service is quick even when they are busy.  This is the perfect casual restaurant.  The decor is funky  and cool.  There is even a pinball machine!"Will return again and again I am sure.""""Solid vegetarian and vegan food, great coffee in a cool atmosphere. What else can you want? ""I had the breakfast burrito with tofu (the """"black and gold"""" I believe it's called) and it was quite good. The ambiance is correctly described as """"hipster"""" and it's exactly what you'd expect from a hipster vegetarian coffee shop/restaurant. ""Five effing stars.""""Everyone I show this place to loves it. Yes it's totally hipster and funky. Yes, hipster service isn't going to walk up to you all bubbly and smiley and be super cheesy to you. But the employees are chill, and it's all about the food, milkshakes, and coffee. The rotating menu is awesome, and I've tried a lot and never gotten anything bad. The chai milkshakes are amazing, as are all of their drinks. I'm not even a vegetarian and this one of my favorite places to go over and over!""My husband and I stopped going here, back in 2010, because of the bad service we were receiving. We used to call the servers ""Whole Foods Rejects""; they were always cranky and we felt not welcomed, rushed. At the end of 2011, I think they got a new manager, the service has been optimal and we haven't stopped going since. Their food is delicious as well as their drinks and coffee."Great chill spot! Definitely hipster."The staff is super awesome. Great place to have a coffee and chill, write, or for dinner. The food (very vegan friendly!) is really good and a great price.""Glad to see this spot still around when I visit back home.""""My boyfriend and I come here every other Saturday, at a minimum. He gets the QHF with eggs, I get the QHF tofu, side of onion gravy. It's potatoes, eggs or tofu, cheese, seisage, PICKLED ONIONS (the best), and this yummy aioli (let's be honest, it's mayo). I wouldn't call it healthy (maybe I'll consider adding some vegetables to switch it up), but it's the perfect hangover food or post-long run indulgence. They do have many healthier options as well, we're just hooked on the QHF and can't stop. I have also loved the country burrito, grits, and hangover hash. They only have the QHF on Saturdays (and other days) and have a different pre-fix drink included brunch menu on Sundays. The coffee is delicious also. ""Sometimes I wish the staff were a bit friendlier, but they're all pretty busy running around. ""The absolute best part is that they're always crowded but there's almost never a wait when we go, which makes for the perfect brunch spot!""""My word, this place is outstanding. I have been here twice from out of town and both times were the highlights of my trips. The food is excellent, this time I had the country burrito (double gravy, yeah baby!). The portions are large and out quickly.""The food is almost besides the point though because QS really excels in the refreshment department. This is one of the few places that makes me wish I had more than one life to live, because I know without living in PGH I will never have a chance to try all of the incredible milkshake, coffee, lemonade and """"other"""" cold and hot drink options. I mean, they have TEA milkshakes. Extraordinary. "Service was friendly and quick. Street parking is ample. The interior is bright and welcoming."6 stars. No. 7 stars.""""The food here will blow you away. The depth of creativity of the items, the menu's being designed around what's available to increase both creativity, changes and environmental sustainability and the overall unique interior design are all screaming at fans to come back. Do love it from the second I drove past it and screeched to a halt. Glad I did.""I don't & can't drink coffee so I can't speak for anything but the Earl Grey Tea which is good, as it is in many other places.""Overall, go.""""I had about half a day to kill in Pittsburgh, and this is where I ended up. Traveling with food restrictions for any reason can be quite difficult these days, and Quiet Storm was a sanctuary for me to just sit down and have an awesome, vegan meal without worry of going into anaphylaxis.""I had a bowl of something-something with I think tahini sauce and veggies and a huge thing of hot tea (I had laryngitis and was just very, very sick so I can't recall much other than how good my food and tea was), and my fiancee had a sandwich that came with some chips and really, really, really good salsa!""The restaurant is just down the street from the Children's Hospital and I'm just really glad my fiancee found this place so I could eat safely without worry.""""We love Quiet Storm.  My kids (aged 5 &2) and I are all vegan, and this is the only place we can go out to eat where everybody is happy.""Nothing matches in this place! The tables, the chairs, the tiles and that's how we like it! Lots of delicious vegan items. Definitely a good place to try new things. Good coffee too!""I can't believe it's taken me so long to try Quiet Storm.  Weekend brunch was great vegan comfort food. We had VTL (messy, delicious red potato smash with seisage, scrambled tofu, and queso), Country Burrito, and sweet Nyam (corn and coconut spiced pudding cake with banana and sweet potatoes). We started with the vegan nachos which were super tasty. Friendly staff and kid friendly, even on a busy Saturday afternoon.""I love quiet storm! I think it's as good as you can get for vegan cuisine. The country burrito is BOMB! So good, there has to be crack in the gravy. I also enjoy the tahini queso, I often add it to my burrito. It's best on the nachos. For around $13 you can get a delicious filling breakfast/brunch coffee/tea included. They also have great pastries & dairy free coffee drinks & milkshakes! It's a vegan dream come true. It does get a little crowded during Saturday mornings so expect a wait, but completely worth it. The atmosphere is oozing with hipster ambiance associated with the area (Garfield) which also means they often play good music! Last time I was there it was all Neil Young! Accompanied my burrito perfectly! I definitely recommend this place to vegans & NON-vegans alike!""My favorite place in Pittsburgh. Everything is fantastic, but I would have to say the country burrito is the best. Amazing. Good people, maybe not the best staff, but who cares. Once they plop down that burrito, you've got a lot of work on your hands.""I live in the neighborhood and this is one of my top 5, maybe top 3 places in the city. "Creative dishes.Well-made.Really yummy!"My favorites have been the Thai peanut wrap with tofu, the Jamaicanish cornmeal/coconut cream/pineapple/yam bake, and their unique milkshakes. So nice to see vegan milkshakes! Their breakfast bowls are super good too.""It's such a nice environment and the waitstaff is funny and friendly. I go here fairly often and would love to go even more!"""The best vegetarian/vegan restaurant in Pittsburgh is also my neighborhood watering hole--I'm so fortunate. The food is great (especially love the ginger sunflower dish and spicy peanut wrap) though newcomers may think otherwise. You have to appreciate what they can do without meat or other animal products. The drinks are amazing.The hipster atmosphere reminds me of Portlandia. Staff is friendly. Gets busy at brunch time on the weekends."Quiet Storm gets 4 for its food, 5 for cool factor, and 5 overall.""""Let me first say that I have been a vegetarian for 15 years and have never been to a veg restaurant before. Looking through the menu here I actually got excited, because I didn't have to ask ""does this have meat in it"" a million times. THERE WERE SO MANY CHOICES! I have the excitement of the little girl on Despicable Me ""It's So FLUFFYYYY!"" ""My excitement aside, the menu was pretty large for all veg food. They have breakfast all day, which is always ok with me. Prices were average (~8.50), and portions were large enough to provide lunch for the next day. (Although I have heard that the Cuban Sandwich is on the small side).""I had the Banh Mi, which was fabulous. The bread was fresh, aioli was nice, vegs were pickled just right, but the tofu was a little on the dry side (on next day lunch reheat it was perfect). I was surprised by the veg seisage. It was really good. ""Gazpacho was nice, although I am not really a fan of cold soup. It reminded me of a smoother salsa. Good, but just not my thing.""Sarah S. had the special, home fries with chili and cheese.  This was on the spicy side (a good thing) and came with tortilla chips. She was happy with it. "Latte's are good too."All in all this was a good experience! I think this is my new favorite place.""""Great atmosphere, lots of owl decorations.  The staff are very nice and are really trendy. It looks like they are working hard. I experienced fast service even though the cafe was almost full. Temperature was nice and the noise was average, they have some good window tables. I would say there is a good mix of regular neighborhood locals here, hipsters, and intellectual types. The demographic also includes college students. It's all Vegetarian or vegan, yay!  The food is normally very good.  I did have one experience where in terms of how spicy I wanted my meal I replied, 0 out of 10.  The food came and my dish was probably an 8 out of 10 in terms of spicy-ness.  I could barely eat it as could others at my table.  Eventually I gave up trying to finish it.  I could have asked for a replacement but I chose not to but Im certain they would of fixed it for me if I had.  But other than this instant I've found the food fresh and well cooked.""I was somewhat worried about going here since the reviews seem to be bimodal, so I was pleasantly surprised when our food was flavorful (some reviewers complained of blandness) and not trying to imitate meat (some reviewers said that seemed to be the goal), but exploiting the wonderfulness of vegetables and scrambled tofu (which, despite the other complaints, was just fine). We had the ""tenders"" appetizer, with both the vegan BBQ sauce and the vegan wasabi mayonnaise. We much preferred the BBQ sauce, but I am guessing if you are a wasabi fan, you would like that too. We all thought it was wonderful. On the advice of the server, I had the peanut wrap. It was spicy, heavily peanut-flavored, but full of yummy veggies. I also had a side of chili, that I liked a lot (and I make my own veggie chili at home, so I am picky). Ben had the apple panini with the gazpacho side. We both thought the gazpacho was kind of plain (it got better by adding chili!), but the apple panini (with ""seisage"", cheese, etc.) was very good. Finally, Panchu had the coconut burrito, which was huge, but he ate the whole thing, and was very happy. We all split a vegan cinnamon roll for dessert, and I really wish I had been able to get my own!""Some complained about the wait; I think this place fits well with the """"slow food movement."""" If you want fast food, go to McDonald's.""So, based on one observation, I gave it five stars. YMMV.""""Quiet Storm is a delicious and cozy little place located in the colorful Bloomfield area. The buildings surrounding Quiet Storm are often painted with cute art or have little interesting things about them. I love this neighborhood, but I love Quiet Storm even more! ""I've only been here twice, and I always want to go more often but somehow it doesn't happen. I've turned on three of my friends to Quiet Storm too, and they love it just as much. The first time I visited I ordered a tofu hash. It was an amazing blend of seasonal vegetables, including some I would never eat otherwise. The tofu was nice and firm, the seisage was spicy and perfectly chewy. The vegan """"cheese"""" sauce was also rich and delicious.  The portion was so huge, I couldn't finish it. Leftovers are rarely as good as when the meal is fresh, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that my leftovers were even BETTER than the fresh meal. I think this is because the spices and vegetables had more time to meld together in a perfect veggie harmony. ""The second time I visited was 4/21/2013. A group of my friends came here for Brunch. Two of us ordered the Vegan Country Burrito, another friend ordered the french toast with pistachio honey topping and my other friend ordered a tofu hash with black beans and salsa. Everything was generously portioned, but some meal choices were sold out. They were a bit disappointed that there was no more falafel. All of us devoured our plates and happily chattered about the complexity of flavor, protein content in vegan food items and how much we loved the atmosphere. ""Quiet Storm is a great little place to visit. It's never lacking in interesting things to look at while you eat. Food comes as quickly as possible. There are plenty of options to please everyone, and if you think you don't like vegetables, try one of their plates and you may change your mind. (Seriously, I am one of those vegans who hates veggies, but Quiet Storm food can get me to finish all of mine) ""Tip: If you want to go for Sunday brunch, go early so your favorites will still be available. ""You may also want to nudge the servers a little more than you usually would, because even though our drinks were bottomless, it was a pain to get them back to give us refills - even for water."""I always love going here for some quality vegetarian fare."Our favorite place to go for chocolate peanut butter soy milkshakes. We've been for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and everything we've gotten has been incredibly delicious. Love this place!""The food: A lot of interesting flavors, big portions, fresh ingredients. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu.""The atmosphere: chill, love the second-hand objects from thrift stores decorations and the corner booth that's not in a corner.""Service: Everyone is super friendly. It seems like they work there because they also like the food and atmosphere, and give good suggestions if you can't decide on what to get."""Great pizza! "I practically lived there when I lived in Shadyside.

Unheard of from me until now! The shady side special is the only pizza we have ever ordered from here and I'm pretty sure it's the only thing we ever will order because it is just that fantastic! I mean I hate canned black olives and this thing is loaded with them but they aren't overpowering. The combination of all the flavors makes my mouth sing its so happy. Sadly, we live over an hour away so it's a very rare time that we travel to shady side and don't have a sit down meal as opposed to take away pizza.""The service here is always very friendly and quick. My husband used to save up to order a shady side special when he was in school. Seriously any meal that he saves up for better be amazing and this is!""""I'm a vegetarian so a lot of times I have to just settle for an Italian-no meat, or a lack-luster veggie only sub... but the Mediterranean at Pizza Perfectta is by far the best sub/hoagie I have ever ordered from a pizza place. Garlicky, not too soggy, great cheese and flavorful toppings- I LOVE IT. I can't speak to any other hoagie because it's the only one I get. 5 stars, everybody.""I order from Pizza Perfecta all the time, and they always turn out to be excellent. I love the crust, and their vegetarian options on the menu are pretty good.""Fresh, prepared quickly, and always delicious! Everything tastes like it is from scratch--recommend the hoagies, salads, and specialty pastas. Spinach feta and Mediterranean pizzas have amazing crusts!""This is a 5-star neighborhood pizza delivery joint. I've ordered from here multiple times, and the quality was consistent and the delivery was timely and friendly. The food comes hot, and they never forget to give utensils, condiments and napkins.""I've ordered the Wings with Garlic and Parm, which comes in a oven-safe container for leftovers. The Buffalo fries are great as well- and if you top it with cheese you also get the aluminum container. We all know food tastes better when its reheated in the oven.""The Chicken Ranchero Pizza is great, but I feel pretty guilty about eating it, so I just order regular pizza with random toppings that I'm in the mood for. My other favorite item is the Cheesy Breadsticks.""Consistent, delicious quality with reliable delivery=5 stars. I've walked by the store itself- it's a takeout place.""""This is hands down the best pizza place in Pittsburgh.  It has a modest exterior, but you can't judge a book by it's cover.  This used to be my regular pizza place when visiting family in Pittsburgh and now I make it a point to go back whenever I'm in town.  Coming from the NY/NJ area which is pizza and Italian food heaven, you can say I'm picky when it comes to my pizza and I often find it difficult to find good pizza outside of the area where I live, but Pizza Perfectta totally delivers with great taste every time.  The sandwiches and side orders I've tried have all been great as well.  Top it all off with reasonable prices and friendly service, and these guys got me as a loyal customer for life whenever I'm in Pittsburgh."This is really good food...I just order a delivery which was really fast and hot..the pizza is good a long with the hoagie which can feed four people...if your looking for good pizza this is the place to go...."Easily the most delicious pizza in the Shadyside. Their delivery service is always on time, and most of the time it's early! I think there's only been one instance where I was waiting the full time that they had given for the delivery. They've got tons of topping options, and they are competitively priced compared to some of the other pizza joints in the area.""Tillies!! If you like Italian food, you should be eating at Tillies! I am reviewing Pittsburgh area restaurants because I live here. If you want good food and great service, go to Tillies! Get the house Italian dressing on your salad, try the zucchini, and any dish that you order that has spaghetti sauce or meat sauce is a WINNER!!! Chicken parm is delicious and so is the Marsala!! Enjoy!!""Great pizza. They sent us the wrong bread sticks at first (regular instead of cheesy), but quickly fixed it without issue.""When I noticed our cat had worms (ew) I called up the Point Breeze vet and they took us in the same day, despite the fact that we'd never been there before. The receptionist even explained what prices to expect, which was super helpful. Now our cat is a regular client, much to his chagrin.""I took my two cats to this vet for a couple years and always received good, friendly, and quick service.  One of my cats is on a prescription diet, which I need to buy at a vet, and every time I called for it, the Point Breeze Veterinary Clinic either had it in stock or was able to have it available by the next day.""Everyone at Point Breeze Veterinary Clinic was friendly and helpful, and I'm so pleased with our new vet, Dr. Samard!  She diagnosed my cat's food allergy with speed and certainty and now we have a gameplan for trying to root out the offending allergen.  Two previous vets dropped the ball on this one.  Not only did Dr. Samard figure it out easily, she seemed to know just about everything about feline food allergies and deceptive hypoallergenic cat food products."She also gets points for spitting in the face of death by actually reaching inside the mouth of my 17 pound vet-hating pissy calico (who required canvas gloves and to be entirely covered in a thick towel) to manually chip tartar off her daggerteeth."And the whole visit, with rabies vaccines for two cats, was under $150.  Hooray!""""These guys are great. We took our more mature, distinguished hound  for a check up and meds for worms and they were so kind and gentle. They truly love animals here and are willing to work with you if you have payment issues as well. They always seem to have an opening on the same day when I call, which is a huge plus! Dr Simard is really awesome and not afraid to be covered in slobber which is a way of life for any Basset owner. Dr Gerson is really great also- funny guy (kind of gruff, but kind if you look beyond that). An overall wonderful practice run by professionals!""I took my cat here for a preliminary checkup after adopting her from the animal shelter & then again to have her declawed. I was very impressed by the facilities and service. The facilities are spotless & modern, and the vets seem both knowledgeable and willing to spend time with you and your animal."I was particularly impressed when I had my cat declawed. They kept her for several days to monitor my progress & called me each day to update me on her progress."It seems a bit expensive (although I have no other point of comparison) but the service is well worth it.""""OMG where to begin. I had a very sick kitty who had been to the ER twice. I was already $1,500 in the hole for vet bills in 2 weeks for an 11 month old kitten, I took her to AVETS and all they wanted to do was cut her open (I was not gonna go that route). She was very sick one night so I was frantically searching for a  2nd opinion. My husband and I showed up on their doorstep just as they opened and I was desperate to have her evaluated by a fresh pair of eyes. The first person we encountered was so sweet and I could tell she really wanted to help us and god bless her she got us right in (thank you) and I am sorry I never got your name. We saw Dr.Simard who is amazing, she was very kind and empathetic with regard to our situation. I was so stressed and so tired from not sleeping that I almost broke down in her clinic (I am in medicine and I am usually a rock), and her swift thinking outside the box that had both diagnostic and comfort in mind for my lil one. She ran some tests and started treatment and more importantly she made me feel like we are gonna figure out a DX and everything will be OK. My lil Lulu is feeling much better and I want to thank everyone at PBVC for making it happen, they gave us excellent healthcare with GREAT bed side manor & I would recommend this practice to anyone."This place is great.  I have been taking all of our dogs (five over the years) to them and have nothing but admiration for them.  The service is always prompt and caring.  I highly recommend them."I've been bringing my cats here for about 30 years. The vets and techs are fantastic. They treat my animals and me with patience, kindness and respect. Dr. Schroth saw my latest two cats through their final illnesses. She was incredibly empathetic. I felt very comfortable asking her questions. The front office staff is also great. I can't say enough good things about this place.""This is a great little neighborhood market with a terrific friendly atmosphere. There's a large deli menu and very fresh tasty coffee, in addition to your standard one-of-everything-else lining the shelves. Its proximity to Frick Park makes it an excellent place to stop for sandwiches and provisions for a picnic. There are also a couple of tables and chairs lining the sidewalk outside in case you want to stick around. If you get really into the market, or the Point Breeze neighborhood, you can even buy a commemorative t-shirt to remember it all.""There is nothing better than a neighborhood market, and Frick Park Market fits the bill. Come here for grocery staples, a great homemade sandwich (get the breakfast sandwich, any of them!), or just to hang out. The owner will be there & is happy to talk to you.""The best part about the market, though, is when the kids get off school & come into the store for candy & soda. You can tell that the business is connected to the neighborhood and that everyone gets along. Pittsburgh treasure!"""It's been two years since I've last reviewed Frick Park Market?  Time to write an update!   I came here recently on my day off and had me a sammitch!  "Whoa, baby!  Do I have to upgrade this to a five-star review or what?!!  This place knows how to do a pastrami on rye right!  To start with, they use Boar's Head meats here, which are some of the best deli meats around.  Second of all, they size the sandwich just right.  It's not small, but it's not so ginormous that you can't finish it.  The meat is layered just perfectly on it and they don't slather on the condiments (presentation is every bit as good as taste, folks).  Third, the bread tastes like it was delivered just this morning.  Fourth, they top it off with a really good pickle.   Finally, when you bite into it, the sandwich doesn't overpower you--instead it melts delicately in your mouth.  M-m-m-m-m, you wanna savor it.  ""Frick Park Market is much more than a deli though.  You can get convenience foods, milk, ice cream, etc, here.  As I mentioned before, it's a great place to stock up on snacks if you're going hiking in nearby Frick Park.  And as Joseph said, the owner is happy to talk to you.  Frick Park Market is a small neighborhood treasure."""anything you need you can find it at the market :)"My son Marc and I stopped by on our way into the city just becasue he is a fan of Mac. When we pulled up and entered we were greeted by a lady who could not have been kinder. She knew we were from out of town so asked Marc if he was a Mac fan, Once he said yes she went onto tell some stories.  While I was ordering my sandwich, she took the time to give Marc the story behind ""The Story""....  She showed him the sandwich Mac made during the video and also let him hold the tab books that were used as props for the video and even snap a few pictures. ""  Sadly, we never asked the kind lady her name but if by chance she see's this post I'd like to thank her again because she made Marc's day. Oh and yes the sandwiches are awesome.... If and when we go back to Pittsburgh I know where I'm going for lunch!""""Used to live two blocks away and now I miss having it so close! Great sandwiches, and would always get my weekly bag of coffee and milk. The owners are friendly and helpful.""We recently stayed at a small place a few doors away from this market and came in for coffee every morning.  The owners are very nice. They have great coffee & biscotti.  Good selection of cold cuts and pastries.  Everyday the was a different, delicious smelling homemade soup cooking.""The East End Food Co-op has just about everything you would expect to find in a food co-op, except for--sadly--a great selection of local beers.  This tragic fault does not rest with the co-op, of course, but with the state of Pennsylvania.  But you probably don't care because you know where all of these elusive ""beer distributors"" are located.""So, to get back on track, I like the local produce focus here, and some of the cheeses appeared to be local, as well.  Nice staff, decent prices, good little salad bar.  I love co-ops, and if you do, too, then you will love the East End Food Co-op.""""On our way back from DC to Chicago yesterday, we stopped off here since my friend swore by it. One of the best co-ops I have ever been to. They have such a huge selection of products. If you are looking for vegan cheese, this place has a humongous selection including Sheese, which my bud says is really hard to find. They carry my beloved Temptations soy ice cream even in chocolate chip cookie dough. Nummers! I grabbed delicious produce, a spinach and feta & olives-zaatar pie made by Najat's Cuisine, a STILL WARM ginger cookie made there, a raspberry ginger beer, and I'm sure I am forgetting something. I would come here all the time if I lived in Pittsburgh. Their hot food looked good, but I wanted something to grab and go.""Funny thing, in the time that we were there, three people commented that they really liked my tattoos. Then the cashier said he liked my Obama button. I love this place!""""The East End Food Co-op has become my favorite place to get groceries. I've recently changed to eating vegan and this place has everything I need. The bulk food section is awesome from all types of organic flour to organic candy, granola, rice, pasta, teas, coffee, even bulk tamari. You can bring your own container and fill it up. If not, bags and containers are available. All different types of vegan (as well as some non-vegan) canned goods, soymilks, vegan cheeses, and meat substitutes are available. There is so much crammed into the place sometimes its hard to find what you need, but staff is very friendly and are always there to help. It doesn't have the glitz and glam of Whole Foods but the prices are a little better. If you become a member, once a month you can purchase items at a pretty good discount.""There is nothing like this in chicago!  (that I know of).....I hope I get to stay in Pittsburgh long enough just to take advantage of this co-op.  I love the bulk section, especially since I can choose the quantity of what I want to buy.  Super convenient for travelers.  You can buy pasta, granolla, flour, quinoa, cous cous, cane sugar, spices, YERBA MATE!!!, dried fruit, nuts, olive oil, peanut & almond butter, soap.....man, I could go on & on.  You can buy all of that stuff & choose how much you want of it.  ""I was suprised that they had cacao powder, for such a small place.  They have a nice little section of tofu, tempeh, & seitan next to a bunch of vegan cheese that looked really good.  ""They also have a juice bar & vegetarian """"cafe.""""  I don't think I'd call it a cafe, more like buffet.  I wasn't all that impressed with the food they had cooked, but I'm not going to penalize them for that.  For such a small place it's pretty amazing what they already have going on there.  I really want to try something from their juice bar too!!  ""There must be someone dj'ing the music in the store because I heard some great music that you wouldn't hear on the radio.  Everyone was very curteous and nice.  I should try to make friends with these people since I'm new in town."""I don't know how I would survive without this place."As a transplant from Arcata, Ca...I need my weird hippy sh*t man. And I prefer to stay away from giant corporations like whole foods as much as possible."I always go here to buy local honey and get goat's milk soap.And they have a great selection of pre-made food (I love the tabouli and hummus wrap and the greek salad sandwich) and the salad bar is awesome."It's true that it's tiny, but as someone who comes from a place that's crawling with stores like this...I feel lucky that Pittsburgh has one at all. I mean, people ask me, """"Where did you get that?"""" and I say the East End Co-op, and then they just stare at me blankly. They have no idea what in the frak I'm talking about. """"The what?...where is that?""""""There are bigger places like Right by Nature, but it's just not the same.""The Co-op feels like home.""""Stopped by here on my drive across country to stock up on some tasty, healthy snacks. Nice selection of bulk foods. If I lived in Pittsburgh, this is where I would shop all the time.""this is one of the best health food stores i've ever shopped at. the prices overall are pretty good in terms of the size and type of the store. plus there are regularly sales which help make the prices easier to swallow. the bulk and pre-made food sections are really wonderful, and there is always a good selection of local produce. ""the staff is knowledgeable and very friendly and they give a 10cent coupon for bringing your own bags."""In need of healthy goodness today! Parked right out front. There were a decent amount of patrons but nothing that would make me growl at the person standing in front of the Thai coconut soup I so desperately wanted. "First thing I did was order a wheat grass shot and my favorite juice bar drink...Dante's Inferno! It is a bright red drink that contains organic beets, carrot, celery, ginger, and garlic. I never get it with garlic even though you should. I can't handle that much garlic in a drink. I'm a wuss. ""Hot foods was bumpin' but I was still able to stroll around and decide on what Indian Kitchen cookery would go in the belly for dinner. A little tofu surprise, chickpea curry, steamed kale, steamed veggies with big slices of zucchini, and a few red lentil scoops. Everything looked fresh and delicious. After grabbing 2 soups and my dinner I downed my sweet wheat grass shot and was ready to get home. At the register they forgot to ring up the shot but I had to let them know. All smiles as I left. Don't forget to tip the juice bar peeps."""The husband and I get so excited each week for grocery shopping because of the co-op. I love it so much."We need this place in our lives. It gives us hope and makes us feel like we belong. I have never, in my entire life, eaten better broccoli. I sometimes obsess about this broccoli and go through withdraws when we run out. The beet hummus is to die for and the wraps are incredible. I also like the beauty section and natural makeup and night creams. ""Yes, some stuff can be pricer that Trader Joes's, like the Amy's frozen pizzas, but it is so worth it becasue you know that the extra $ is going towards a good cause.  We got a membership last year and rarely go anywhere else.  And our dog attacks his bowl when we feed him his food. He won't even go near anything else, which we sometimes have to resort to when he runs out.""""I just found this place a month back and I'm kind of blown away by how awesome it is. Fresh produce, awesome prepared salads and dips, bulk everything, natural cleaners, and plenty of hippie garbage you can't help but fill your shelves with. The best part is that they try to stock up with locally sourced produce, milk, and meat. And you can get a good discount if you purchase stock in the co-op.""You gotta love co-ops. Especially this one! It embraces its east end neighborhood, makes amazing products available to the community, and in general feels like it cares, which is the only acceptable vibe for anything calling itself a cooperative! I mostly go here for the juices, honestly, but I'll tell you why: EEFC is literally the only place in Pittsburgh proper to get your hands on some straight, non-pastuerized juicer juice. Why is this not a thing here?! Even the Whole Foods is lacking a juice bar!! Seems juice is the new Pittsburgh Mexican food. Sheesh!""This is a great stop for fresh everything! I crave their juice on a regular basis. Shot of kale, YES! The salad bar and hot foods bar are also great, hot foods change on a regular basis but always have vegan/veg options. Aside from a quick dinner/grocery shopping location, we tried their weekend brunch. My bf loved everything, and the prices were great for a full plate of food. I, myself devoured some vegan pumpkin bread and a delicious fair-trade coffee. I also love their to-go foods selection, full of vegan-friendly wraps, salads and more - great for picnics! The staff is very friendly and it's obvious they like their jobs. The bulk foods and produce sections are also impressive! I wish it was closer, but it's worth the commute!""The only place I grocery shop! I love the fresh local produce. I love that I am a member.  They have recently been remodeling the place, which has only made it even better! I feel lucky that I live so close to the Co-op!"This is such a fantastic place to buy your groceries!"The store in on the smaller side, but they are well stocked with lots of fresh vegetables, fruits, and other organic treats. I LOVED the fact that many of their items are local, especially the delicious bread!""Everybody was also very nice and helpful. Great place to come check out if you haven't yet."""I absolutely love this place and wish there had been something similar in Orlando (one where you don't have to be a member)."I randomly found out about East End when I was doing a search for organic, local food products. We decided to go check it out and instantly fell in love. Their produce selection is second-to-none, seriously. And yes, I am including Giant Eagle in that!""Seriously, just about every time we've gone all the produce looks so fresh and brightly colored (i.e., the peppers, tomatoes, fruits, etc.) and ripe. I also like how they carry pasta noodles, rice, and other fun things in bulk. We always lament about how since there's only the two of us, we don't always need the large offerings that you usually find at places like Giant Eagle. Being able to pick out just the amount you need and not letting anything go to waste makes me feel a lot better.""Beyond the food products, I have also gotten into making my own body washes. East End carries all of the ingredients that I need with multiple options. They have recently redone their store (and are still renovating) and have expanded their meat (they didn't use to carry meat at all) and cheese selections tremendously. The meat is a little pricey, actually the whole store is little pricey, but in my opinion it is well worth it. It's nice knowing that the items are organic and come from sustainable farms. Bonus: they buy as much locally produced items as they can as well. ""I really have nothing bad to say about them. The service has always been great and I love the selections and products offered. I can't comment on the cafe as I haven't eaten at it, but I hear the food is great. A combination of East End and the Strip has pretty much replaced Giant Eagle for me. I only stop by there now if I'm close by and just need a few items really quick.""""Yes.  I love the co-op.  It's one of the very few places in Pgh I've been able to find unpasteurized juice, besides my own counter top.  Because my counter top contains a juicer, which is awesome, but such a pain to clean.""I love getting lunch here.  The onion Parmesan soup is amazing.""""The best grocery store I've been to. Lots of organic fruit and veggies, bulk bins for as far as the eye can see, and if you can't find a type of granola you like then you should give up on granola.""They basically have everything you need, and you don't have to shop at the chain stores.""""I was visiting Pittsburgh and looking for a throat spray called Singers Saving Grace. Whole Foods didn't have the item in stock but East End Co-Op did! Also, had a smoothie while a shopped. ""What a great find!""""Forget Whole Foods when you have East End Cooperative! Honestly, this is quite possibly one of my favorite coops. They make some amazing deli items...so amazing that I went back twice during my visit to PA. I was only expecting to have a few options in the prepared food section, but the vegan options were plentiful. Their mock tuna salad was impressive, made with tvp, vegenaise, and spices. The potato salad was creamy and exceptionally delicious. And the vegan pasta salad was also impressive. Generally most grocers fail in this department, but East End excels by leaps and bounds. I can't believe how tasty their store-made food was. The prices were also very reasonable, if not low. If I lived in PA, I'd join their coop and would go there frequently.""Great selection, tasty salad bar.""I used to work there and I just love East End Food Co-op.  The place has definitely got soul, awesome folks at Co-op.  So many local options, such good produce, and awesome prepared foods.  Sure some of the prices are high, but if you learn to shop it, there are also great values everywhere.  ""And I really appreciate that they stick their neck out, and are spending time and money in the fight to label GMO's.  It's important issues like this that really define our Co-op IMO.""""Love the East End Food Co op .  Reasonably priced organic selections.  The smoothie/juice bar is outstanding.  Great vegan/and or healthy selections at the hot and cold salad bar.  My most favorite thing here is the ability to purchase raw, unpasteurized unhomogenized milk.   ""The staff is very friendly, the. produce is very fresh.  This is definitely a good way to avoid the over priced, over processed major grocery chain food selection.  I love the co op."""When I go organic I go here and reccommend the same to my clients!Mark CPT "bestpapersonaltrainercom""""Organic, vegan, vegetarian, juice bar, and much more.  This place is friggin heaven.  ""When I made the initial switch to vegetarian a few years ago I struggled.  Not from the desire, but from a lack of options.  Then I found the Co-Op. ""In my opinion the Co-Op is just as valuable as public libraries!!!"""East End Food Co-op is awesome!"If I had to choose between the Co-op and WF, the Co-op is where it's at.""There is a good selection of fruits and veggies, as well as toiletries (shampoos, soaps, toothpaste, tampons, shaving creams, etc.) to household cleaning products. The frozen section is also very diverse with a good selection of frozen meals, ice cream (dairy and nondairy), and veggies. The Co-op also carries a nice selection of foods for people with restricted diets especially for Celiac and vegans, or for people with severe allergies like myself. ""They also carry hard to find vegan cheeses such as Treeline that I have difficulty finding at WF in Pittsburgh and the Co-op in West Virginia. I was also happy to find that they had my favorite Ito-En sencha green tea shot (it's just green tea in a can, it's not like one of those energy shots at all). ""The deli is also fantastic, and I highly recommend the Co-op deli over the WF deli. There are a wide variety of soups and salads and dressings. The vegan mushroom soup is really, really, really yummy. There are also vegan meals in ready to go containers (salads, vegan pesto noodle salad, etc.). You can also order coffee/espresso at the deli counter. As with any good Co-op, they have a variety of non-dairy milk options. ""If you have food allergies or have any dietary restrictions the Co-op is an excellent place to get a quick meal (hot or cold) and to pick up groceries. There is also a little dining/sitting area at the front of the store. It's kid friendly and they even have a little compost/recycling bin! Yes, this is important for me to mention because I come from Seattle where recycling is the norm and we get fined if we don't recycle..and recycling does not seem to be a big thing in WV where I currently live. ""There is also a community board if you are looking to post something up (events, classes, pet sitting, etc.) near the bathroom in the back of the store.""""I love supporting co-ops and other local grocers, but for whatever reason, I kept putting off visiting East End Food Co-op. This all changed yesterday when I was desperate for a healthy smoothie and nowhere near one. ""We were a little confused as to how to get into the co-op, because didn't realize that it was on the opposite street all tucked away. After we figured that out by following another patron, we were really excited to walk through the doors. ""If you've never been into a co-op, you should know that they are typically smooshed together and have an interesting smell that emanates from the bulk-spices isle. I love this smell. It's really the best grocery store smell, EVER.""Proceeding through the store we noticed the colorful and abundant produce section. So many beautiful fruits, veggies and herbs. The prices varied, but they were probably on par with what you would pay for any other organic produce somewhere else. ""When we found the back area with hot foods, cold foods and the smoothies...I died of happiness. There were so many wonderful things back there. The food bar is $7.99 a pound, which is a lot cheaper than some places! The smoothies were all very tasty sounding, but I settled on a smoothie with soy ice cream, strawberries and papaya juice. Oh, my, god. It was so delicious! My boyfriend got the King smoothie, and he really enjoyed his too."Right beside the smoothie bar there is a section for all kinds of books. My eye was caught by an organic and local homebrewing book. It is now on my list of must haves! "The rest of the store was great. I especially love the cheese selection (we bought AMAZING and LOCAL tomato-basil havarti), the vegan meat products and the prices. ""I'll definitely be coming here a lot more. It's a great little co-op, and it is definitely the best I have been in!""""The co-op is great!  When we had to put our children on a diet free of gluten and dairy, we were lost -- until we found the East End Food Co-op. That was 10 years ago and I've shopped there weekly ever since. It provides for all of our gluten-free, dairy-free needs - and even allows the opportunity to purchase in bulk as a member. I also love buying grains, beans, etc. from the bulk bins, fair trade products and many daily food items like cereals, nut butters, snacks, etc. They now stock meat/poultry from local farms and specialize in Vegan options. Also, have to mention the awesome produce section, stocked mostly from local farms.""I had driven by East End Food Co-Op over 100x throughout the last 3 years and would frequently comment, ""I need to check it out!"" Well, finally, a couple weeks ago, I decided to randomly swing by the co-op.""I was diagnosed with a soy allergy last year, so I was truly like a little kid in a candy store at East End Food Co-Op. There are so many options that not only accommodate my annoying food allergy but also support incredible local businesses.""For my first East End visit, I snagged several items, including incredible locally-made challah bread, three types of flavorful locally-harvested honey, cognac fig cheese, and my favorite amy's pizza in pesto, a flavor that I have never found elsewhere. Thankfully, I was shopping without a basket or cart, or I would have spent well over $100 on my first trip. Instead, I was trying to balance all my great finds in my arms, which limited my purchases.""My one warning about East End... don't expect Aldi or Trader Joe's prices here. Like Whole Foods, you'll be spending $50 or more on just a bad or two of groceries. Just remember that you're supporting multiple local businesses when shopping here, and you'll leave feeling fulfilled about your money spent!"""The co-op is an invaluable resource for Pittsburgh. "First of all, the selection is fantastic. No matter what kind of health-conscious diet you follow from vegan to paleo - they've got what you need. My favorite items here that you can't really find many other places are raw milk (legal in PA, woo!) and the local meats. The prices on the meat here are higher than most butchers in the area, but on par with the lesser quality meats at Whole Foods - choose your co-op!""I seldom find the produce prices to be ridiculously high. For example, I recently purchased mushrooms at $1.99 per lb. and strawberries for $2.50 per lb., which seem to be two of the more expensive items at any given store. Their sales are worth planning a shopping trip around.""When I followed a plant-based diet, the bulk section was my holy grail. For grains, flours, nuts, and seeds, they have a wide variety of unique products. I also love that you can fill a jar and buy it right at the store - most other bulk sections in the 'Burgh don't have this.""All in all, I like being able to go into a store and not have to sift through the produce to see if it's what I want (organic, local) because it all is! Naturally, they do sell tropical fruits and things that simply do not grow here, but everything is very clearly labeled in its origin and growing method.""The employees are always friendly and helpful as well. The only terrible thing about this place is the fact that there is almost NEVER parking - I've parked in the lot maybe  ten times out of the ~40 or so times that I've shopped here. I don't mind the walk down, but with heavy bags in my hand, the walk up the street can be tough!""""Where do I start??  i LOVE the East End Food Co-op!  One of my colleagues introduced me to the co-op and I was super skeptical, but when I went back by myself I was immediately in love.  I originally went the first time to get some essential oils, but left with that and then some! I've been back quite a few times since then and I can't get enough!  I get a little overwhelmed when I go in if I dont have a very specific list (and even then, if you're not familiar with the products or choices, it can be confusing) but I do love to go in and just explore.. It's really a little piece of heaven for any health food lover.  I love their selections of dairy products and meats as well.. theres also a great supplement section.. I could go on and on, but you get it.  This place is a diamond in the rough and I love it!""If you are looking for hard to find healthy, organic, local food choices EEFC is the place to go.  The largest selection of seasonal fruits and vegetables and a juice bar that is fit for a king.  As a matter of fact that is the name of one of the amazing drinks.""If you're looking for supplements, not only is the selection overwhelming  but the staff is capable of directing you to exactly which supplement you should consider to improve everything from hair loss to weight control or any topic Dr. Oz can muster up.  "Even discussion groups and mini classes are available and free to the public.You won't find this kind of service anywhere in the big box grocery stores."This is a member driven store but you don't have to be a member to shop there.  But if you do you will get even more savings potential.""""Great grocery store -- way better than going to Whole Foods. The vegan choices are plentiful in the store and the cafe. Also, CHAO CHEESE IS HERE!""Construction Junction is a gem. Find gently and not so gently used furniture, building supplies, lighting, and all sorts of other stuff. The warehouse is huge, and if you look, there are some seriously cool treasures here. A giant(I'm talking probably 12' wide) chandelier, a wood-burning stove, 27 tons of sand stone in the parking lot. This is a great place to get cheap building supplies and help out the environment by recycling.""That isn't the best part, though(Well it might be, depending on what you're here for). Construction junction is also home to many other awesome things. Most notably, the space upstairs is aptly named The Space Upstairs - enter from the side into the world of the modern improv dance troupe The Pillow Project( http://www.pillowproject.org/ ). Also, at night this is the location of Pittsburgh's FreeRide ( http://freeridepgh.org/ ) program - a bike information and repair program which encourages people to learn how to fix old bikes to make them new, even offering people a free bike to fix up if they volunteer a certain number of hours. It's also the home of the Steel City Big Pour, a local beer tasting event, and probably a lot more that I don't even know about.""Construction Junction is definitely a treasure trove, and not just for building supplies, but for some of the coolest things in Pittsburgh""""You guys can't even imagine how much I love Construction Junction right now! After trying to work with a few other groups to pick up our old office furniture and having a heck of a time coordinating various logistical issues, the folks at Construction Junction made it so easy! Also, their guys did not even blink an eye when they saw how big/heavy these desks and tables were and got them out of here in no time. I love Construction Junction!""This place is a hidden gem. You NEED to go. I often find myself wondering through CJ finding random things I can turn into artwork. Although my visits are mostly for fun, CJ offers a lot to those who are looking to reuse items they may need for their house. They have random awesome things like basketball flooring and steel pipes, which made for a great new coffee table. The staff is extremely friendly and hard working and CJ is dedicated to donations to charity and the community. I like to frequent this place every month. What a great find. Check it out, if you know what is good for you.""This is a great place to buy re-purposed old windows, office furniture, old industrial sinks, old wood, door knobs, electrical stuff and more for construction projects. Found a matching IKEA office cabinet with one I had for only $20. It was originally $450 and IKEA no longer made it so it was a great find!""This is a great place to find restoration pieces for our old farmhouse.  Just make sure that you measure your doors/windows twice before going.  We live about an hour and a half away, so it's important we have a list and measurements before we set out.  I can't wait to return!""I have spent many hours wandering through Construction Junction. It's the type of place that you have to keep coming back to because you never know when you might find some treasure. They specialize in building surplus and reclaimed materials, so they have everything from an entire back wall full of old doors to full kitchens and a dozen toilets in different colors. It's a great place to check out if you are remodeling your house or if you're interested in finding something funky you'd never be able to find anywhere else. "The staff here is also super helpful and there will always be someone around to help you get your new purchase out to your car. "CJ is also home to one of Pittsburgh's recycling drop off centers, so you can come here to sort out your commingled recyclables and then go shopping for a new mantle or some headless manequins. You really never know what you might find.""""Construction Junction is one of my favorite places in the city. Since I really like to make stuff, every time I walk through I get tons more ideas. When I buy a house, I'll be all over CJ to get awesome furnishings I can refurbish to fill it and fix it up."I love this place. If you have a project that is on a budget or if you just want to go somewhere to get inspired to start a project than this is the place for you. They have everything here including the kitchen sink."After weeks of oogling over the beautiful items posted on the facebook, I just HAD to come in and check it out for myself! I love to DIY and this is definitely the place for me. I almost felt like I was in a dream.  Sinks and cabinets and tiles and chairs and just whatever you could ever hope for! I ended up getting 3 chairs for an upholstering project.  They don't carry fabric, but pointed me in the direction of a craft&DIY store around the corner.""Everything is so neat and organized, I don't know how they do it. All items are also reasonably priced.  The staff is also very friendly and helpful.""All in all, this is definitely the spot for all of your DIY and home needs!""""If you've got that talent to create something out of the unexpected, then you HAVE to stop here."I was looking for something unusual to use in my apartment for storage.  I had stopped at several big box stores around the city before here and left each one of them in disappointment. "I must admit, driving to this place I was a little skeptical.  I pulled in and honestly thought that Yelp directed me to a warehouse.  But I did not let that deter me from venturing out of my car and into the building.  Once you walk inside it is like walking into someone's garage that you just want to rummage through.  You know what I mean, you walk in and see all this dingy looking stuff that you see potential in.  You want to take it home with you.  sometimes you want to polish it up and make it look new, other times you want to let it be and let that distressed look shine through.""I easily spent a hour in here just browsing the shelves.  I saw potential in a lot of the items I saw lining their shelves.  And I took a few items home with me.  When I reached the register I was truly floored by the price.  When I say that, it's because it was so low.  I was expecting to pay more, but I definitely came out of there with more money in my pocket than I needed to, but that is one sure fired way to make sure that a person returns to your establishment.""""12/1/13 got 3 bifold doors for 25 bucks, hard to find antique heater vent cover 10 , outdoor sensor light 4, ------------they have hard to find or odd size vintage/antique everything.  floor trim, paint,  staircase rails, bathroom sinks, counter tops, doors, windows, carpet tiles $1 , tiles back splash, furniture, misc hardware, door knobs, hinges,  some church pew benches large closet safe, front doors, door knobs, open 9-5 daily sunday 10-5-------off n braddock  - past regent square on a side street""I love this place.  I've come here for the odd bits and bobs--brass casters for a piece of antique furniture (25 cents each), vintage milk glass door knobs ($30), wardrobes for a closet-less room ($40 each), a set of four wooden chairs ($10 each), etc.  If you buy something larger, they will hold it for a small fee and then the crew will load it into your truck for you.   If you're into old houses, reserve at least 30 minutes to get through the whole store and you won't be disappointed."As a DIY'er - this place is a sanctuary. I've been here quite a few times during the weekends .. if not to buy .. just to browse around. This place is huge and you can pretty much find anything. If you can't find something you're looking for - you can simply ask one of the CJ personnel making rounds to make sure you've found what you're looking for."I was looking for a bi fold door few weeks ago and found exactly what I was looking for less than $15. - you can find doors as low as $5 and I'm not talking dirty stained or broken door. Besides used goods - there are few new """"recycled"""" items including plastic corrugated roof panels and paints for super low prices.""Also, if you're remodeling your house and need to throw those old materials - they have a number of recycle bin where you can simply drop it off.""""I love this place!  You never know what your going to find!  They have all kinds of things, that are usually slavaged from a home or business.   Kitchen cabinets, tables, mantels, windows, doors, tons of doors!   If your some one who likes to fix old things or make new things out of old stuff, you must go here!  I picked up an old dresser today for $10 its needs the drawer fixed and to be refinished, but when its done its going to look beautiful!  They have old appliances , bathroom sinks and toilets, lighting fixtures, wood, paint, counter tops, flooring materials, some tile, etc., etc.!"I love this place so much! It makes me want to redo the kitchen and bathroom floors in every apartment I rent with vintage tile. Nowhere else in Pittsburgh can you find recycled building materials next to old furniture waiting to be given a new lease on life and mirrors as large as an entire wall. Construction Junction is a treasure trove!"Was turned into this place by a Coworker of my sisters and so today we made the drive from Warren, Ohio to check it out. This place is a DIY and repurposing type persons dream come true! From odds and ends tile to cabinets, hardware and more this place just has soooo much! "You truly need to give yourself time to look around when you go as they have so much. And if you like Pinterest like I do... Give yourself even more time!"For today's adventure we had a specific task so we had to be what we call quick and dirty! No time for strolling and browsing. We got in, went to our specific area and set to work scavenging.  ""We got a bathroom vanity that only needs a little work for 30!!! Once we get it home and paint it, it will look great! It was just what we came for and at an"Amazing price!We almost had a huge slab of Quartz but it would not fit in the van-- not for lack of the gentleman trying though! They gave it a very a valiant effort trying to make it work for us. And I truly can tell you that I have never seen anyone work so hard to make something fit. Gerant and Bennet you guys are the bomb! Thank you a thousand times over for all your hard effort!!!"We will be back!!""""Wow, well deserved 5 stars.""I stopped in today to window shop a door (lol) I needed one for my bedroom and thought this would be the perfect spot after reading reviews. After entering, I realized how awesome it was here! Tons of room doors not to mention front doors, storm doors etc. I also seen a lot of toilets, sink fixtures, cabinets, dressers and so many lighting fixtures including beautiful chandeliers. I have no idea where all of this stuff would've ended if it wasn't for here, but I'm so glad the we have a store like this in the city! I'm excited to bring my fiance here and pick out a door. Out storm door could be replaced too. Everything here was soooooooo reasonably priced! Doors under $25, light fixtures for $5. Love it!"""Dr. Harvey Block is a gentleman and a scholar!"I first came to know these guys after encountering the office manager Linda at my place of work. After talking to her for a few minutes and finding out where she worked I started to tell her of my recent woes with ANOTHER dentist... a botched filling, an infection, a great deal of pain and the need for a root canal. Linda gave me the office's card and insisted that they would see me ASAP if I so desired. I did and it was a great decision, because relief soon followed.  ""I have never had an appointment with these guys that I have not found to be an enjoyable experience. OK...I know that's saying a lot, due to the amount of poking and prodding and rather invasive metal hooks and drills that we all associate with a dentists office, but I'm serious. Everyone in this office from the front desk, the hygienists and the good Doctor himself, are all experts at what they do. The wait times are minimal. Usually, less than ten minutes. It's very rare that a doctor's office will respect the time of their patients in this fashion. There is always a courtesy call to remind you of your appointment a day or two in advance. The work is top notch + the location next to the Co-op is as geographically desirable and  as you can get.""I could go on and on, but instead I'm just going to close by saying, if you are looking for a dentist, you may have just stumbled upon the best one in the Burgh.""Thanks Doc!""""After having my metal fillings removed by another dentist who didn't bother to take the precautions that, I now know, should be taken whenever that procedure is done, my husband and I resolved to find someone whose world view more closely resembled our own. Someone who espouses a more naturalistic approach in dentistry, and who considers the entire individual when they prescribe and treat. We found that dentist in Dr. Block. He's truly invested in the well being of his patients and offers wonderful, all natural mouth and tooth care products. His staff is great too. I have, admittedly, good teeth, so visits to the dentist don't bother me, but I've never experienced pain or discomfort here, and he hires great dental hygienists. Plus, he's a super nice guy. If you're looking for a dentist in the 'burgh, go here.""I hate going to the dentist.  I dread it, it's awful.  It's really important and is vital to your long term well being, however, and I do my best to suck it up.  Harvey is the best dentist that I have been to.  He's a holistic practitioner.  He's done a deep cleaning (worst thing that I could ever imagine), has removed and replaced my lead (""silver"") fillings.  This was important to me and he did them with vacuums so that no trace amounts would be ingested on my part.  He introduced me to a terrific mouth wash that has really made a difference in the health of my gums.  You can tell he really cares about me and my health and I really appreciate how thorough and conscientious he is."Some helpful hints for the Climbing Wall:"-A one-day pass is $12.  College students/active military pay $10.  Wednesday is 1/2 price for ladies (but only after they pay full price on the first visit).  Wednesday is also 1/2 price for guys who wear a sports bra.  Yup, you heard me right.  Wednesdays are usually pretty crowded.""-They run a different membership special every month.  If you climb more than once a week, a membership can definitely be worth it.""-If it's your first time at the wall, I highly suggest just doing the """"bouldering certification"""" instead of the """"safety and belay certification class.""""  The bouldering certification takes about 5 minutes and then you can start climbing.  Decide if you like it, then do the belay certification.""-If you """"like"""" them on facebook, you can get updates about when they change the routes, what membership specials they're running, if they're selling any old/used shoes for discounted prices, etc.  ""The wall is in a great location, on several bus routes, and right next to the East End Food Co-op.  It can get crowded, but everyone takes turns so you have plenty of opportunities.""""I love the Climbing Wall.  There are tons of routes which change fairly regularly in both the bouldering and top roping areas.  There's also a wide variety of difficulty levels in the gym ranging from ones everyone can do to those much more challenging.  Bouldering routes are labeled from VB and V0 (easiest) all the way up to the insanely difficult V7 and V8, while the top roping routes are labeled from Easy to Hard." "Pricing is reasonable, especially on Wednesdays, which is ladies night--$6 to climb (after your first visit).  Other days the price is $12 or $10 for students/military plus the cost of equipment rentals.  If you plan on going at least once a week (or more often like me) buying a membership is the way to go, and there are different specials each month.""Sometimes the gym can get crowded (especially on Wednesdays) but there's lots of routes and it's fun to take some time and meet other climbers.""""Went to this place on a Groupon and fell in love. It reminds me of the days when I lived in Denver. I miss it! The routes are decently hard and allow me to push myself to get better. Staff has always been awesome. People there help give pointers. It does get pretty crowded sometimes, especially on Friday nights. I'd say they are almost in need of an expansion! Keep up the good work, Climbing Wall. I'll be seeing you a lot for the next year :)""My boyfriend and I started climbing about 3 months ago and we love it!  TCW is an awesome place.  All of the routes are challenging and fun, but the bouldering ones test your strength and technique, whereas the toproping ones test your endurance and forethought.  The staff is all very friendly but Lauren and Josh are especially fun to talk to and get pointers from.  I highly recommend checking it out!""I've been climbing for a few years but have friends who have never climbed. This place has lots of climbs at all different levels so my friends and I can enjoy climbing here together.  Plus they have instructional classes if you want to learn more. It has a great atmosphere - a great place to hang out with friends or meet new people. The staff are amazing! Very nice and very helpful. The prices are very reasonable, lower than any other gym I have climbed in (and I have climbed in lots of facilities). I definitely recommend climbing here.""I had the pleasure of bringing a group of 15 young girls to the Climbing Wall recently. I had never climbed before, and neither had the girls, so I cannot comment much on the style or quality of the walls. But, the service we received was extraordinary and deserves 5 stars! ""We had 3 belayers and another gentleman to keep the rotation going smoothly. We started by numbering off, to keep track of everyone. But, by the end of our time, the employees new each of the girls names! They were cheering every girl on and helping them to find the right holds. It was a very personal experience and the girls LOVED it!""I found the experience to be affordable, friendly, and safe. I was never concerned about the safety of any one. If you're looking for a creative group activity or birthday party, I highly recommend The Climbing Wall!""""Wanted to leave an updated review for this place. My first review was too critical. This is a gym in Pittsburgh and you need to set your expectations accordingly. This gym cant go toe to toe with world class gyms like planet granite in sf or Seattle bouldering project in Washington, but given the size of the climbing community at Pittsburgh, this gym is pretty damn good. You can tell they are trying. They have made renovations to improve the gym and improved their setting quality and frequency. All in all, well done and keep up the good work.""First of all, The Climbing Wall ha very helpful and knowledgeable staff who are eager to teach newcomers like myself. Some rock gyms I have been to are very elitist in that you feel like you're the one left out of some inner club, not this place. They are all about getting you interested and involved with climbing and the climbing community. "The walls them self are great with the perfect range of easy to challenging walls. They also change routes frequent enough to never get bored. "Pricing is also very good (especially if you are a student).""""Was referred by another automotive repair shop for a custom exhaust weld. My repair was handled by Isaac. I found him to be a true master at his craft! There aren't many places who do this kind of work anymore and it's a shame. Isaac saved me about $800, as I didn't have to buy the entire exhaust from the dealer.  Everyone at Meineke was courteous and I was out the door in less than 45 minutes. Thank you Isaac from the bottom of my heart!"Not sure why the negative reviews on here? I went there for brakes and got a great deal. They squeezed me in on short notice too since I was going out of town. I'll be going back for more work -- the guys here are great.What a great place! Mark is amazing! We had been at another car repair shop and took it to Mark because he was close by about 1 year ago and haven't left. He is awesome! Always gets us in and they do excellent work at excellent prices. We will be with him for a very long time. Thanks to Mark and Isaac...consummate professionals who really care!!Cafe Zinho was on my list of things to do before leaving Pittsburgh.  But who knew it was closed for lunch in May?"I eventually came here with my parents (who are not accustomed to non-Chinese establishments).  Arriving at 5:30 pm, we still were able to get a table without any prior reservation.  The host was the owner of the restaurant and gave a personal touch to the service."The decor and environment gave Cafe Zinho a nice off-the-beaten path look.  Gypsy and bohemian."Food was superb.  I had the quail, but wasn't given the appropriate utensils to eat it.  My mom loved the lamb.  And of course, the dessert was fabulous.  Since the kitchen is right now nearby, you can see the cooks making your meal or dessert.""This place only accepts cash although there's an atm nearby.  My mom had a fit because when they bill came they had rounded up with a difference of less than a dollar.  I would give this place 4.5 stars, but I rounded up.""""The food at Cafe Zinho is fun, creative, and always spot on delicious.  While the menu changes often, one of my favorites has always been the lamburger, cooked to perfection!  Deserts by Becky are always excellent.  And who would have thought such excellent food would be served out of a redecorated garage?  (It's lovely in the summer when they open the garage door.) The ambiance can be described as funky and eclectic, and actually quite lovely.  It's a BYOB which is great if you want to save a buck or have a great bottle of wine in your cellar."Interesting menu with a lot of things we'd like to go back and try. We started with the Zinho salad that I highly recommend."For entrees, I had a grouper filet with a cucumber mint sauce and a cous cous. It was a subtle dish but very fresh and tasty. My girlfriend had a chicken dish in a great red pepper sauce. The entrees come with these nicely grilled vegetables -- everything tastes really fresh."The Tres Leche cake is incredible!"Great artsy atmosphere with friendly staff. Like previous reviewers have said, it's eclectic but not over the top, and it has a warm and personal vibe. The owners gave us wine. :)""""OK, so I admit that I was underwhelmed by Cafe Zinho when I first went, a few years ago.  And then I didn't go for a long time.  A few months back, my husband and I randomly decided to give it another try, and boy am I glad we did!  It's fantastic, and has quickly become part of our regular line up.""I'll say again that I'm not certain how the food is Portuguese.  That being said, it is mighty delicious.  I love the personal service.  I love the corn bread.  The starters are phenomenal, to the point where I sometimes think that the entrees are superfluous.  But when we get them, they are lovely too.  I love the ambiance.  In short, I owe Cafe Zinho an apology.""""This is the kind of restaurant that I deeply appreciate.  Family-owned.  Off the main roads.  Charming interior.  Unique staff.  WONDERFUL FOOD.  (We called this our ""less-expensive Casbah"" when we left).""Like everywhere we end up going, we go because a Yelp review we have read, that inspired us to give it a try.  We new it was BYOB, but we weren't in the mood for drinking, so we walked on over.  It was our own fault that we got there, at 5:00pm, on the dot - and they were not quite ready to be opened, as they were finishing setting up the tables.  My boyfriend and I took a quick walk around Ellsworth.  It's a family-owned business where they turned their front garage into the most charming, artsy-like, romantic restaurant.  We'll cut them some slack!""When we got back, they were ready for us; and we chose to snag a table outside (they thought we were nuts).  However, in one of the reviews, we read that they had no A/C, which was a big selling point for us (I absolutely loathe going into a freezing cold, A/C'd out restaurant, and being forced to bring a hoodie with me, when it's 90+ outside.  And we do kind of like hot, humid, and muggy); but, I guess they have upgraded because the A/C was BLASTING on the inside of the restaurant.""We started off with the Gazpacho.  This was a perfect summer starter because it was cool, extremely flavorful, and a natural air conditioner to the body.  It had lumps of shrimp and crab meat at the bottom, which made us feel like we were eating somewhere on Duval St. in Key West.  I normally don't like cilantro, but the cilantro was so subtle and completely rounded out the flavor.  When our waitress brought out the freshly baked loaf of corn bread, we sopped up the rest of it.  It is true, the wait staff genuinely appreciates your compliments and feels honored every time you say you enjoyed something.""I ordered the Wild Mushroom Ravioli and my boyfriend ordered the Lamb Burger.  When our dishes came out, they were the most beautiful dishes I had ever seen - full of color, wonderful portion sizing, and aromas just attacking the olfactory with sensational goodness.  My Ravs were topped with this grape tomato paquillo sauce, which tasted like it had hints of red pepper also.  It was FANTASTIC.  Plus, there were whole mushrooms, okra, carrots, and cauliflower on top of the dish as well.  I don't know what kind of separate seasonings were on the veggies, but they were to-die-for also.  I can't exactly remember how many Ravs were in my bowl, but every time I thought I was finished, there was another ravioli to be found, and then another.  For the price - I think there were a total of 10 fully-stuffed, hand-made mushroom ravs.  Incredible.""My boyfriend's Lamb Burger came with a cranberry and raisin jam (but """"jam"""" seems to clichÃ© of a word for this topping), and a salad that had slices of apples in it.  Now I'm usually not one to eat sweeter tasting foods; however, the complementing of sweet and savory in this dish blew my mind.  I'm also not a big fruit eater (unless it's blended in a smoothie), but I totally got past all that because the flavors and the textures all are playing nicely with one another.""We opted out of dessert because we were so stuffed.  But our bill for an appetizer and two filling, insanely delicious entrees came to $40.  DING DING DING DING DING!  WE HAVE FOUND A WINNER!  ""After dinner the owner came over to our table and we were introduced.  What a wonderful, sweet, and genuine older guy.  We will definitely be back before the menu changes again; and next time, we're going for entrees and dessert!! ""One last thing - it is a Cash Only restaurant, but they do have an ATM on-site.""""Great food! The meal starts off with their corn bread (not like the corn bread you get in the south), which is delicious. We've gotten a variety of entrees, including a delicious salmon dish, a quail special, and the lamb burger, all of which were delicious. The restaurant is BYOB, which makes up for the entree cost. I highly recommend a great meal in a small, unassuming location."Well this was unexpected! "After passing by Cafe Zinho for years and years I finally hopped into a hidden Portuguese oasis. Who knew the little hole in the wall near my old hair salon had such good food?! My friends and I had known long about it, but last night we were in need of a BYOB ($5 corkage) and found much more than that. ""We started with two appetizers. (A very good tip from a fellow yelper!) One friend is majorly allergic to gluten and our fabulous waiter MORE than accommodated her questions and requests with patience. We all shared some kind of rice stuffed pepper that was moist and exploding with flavor, I forget the name...but definitely a must-have. We also were excited to try the pan-sauteed (not fried) calamari. I'm not a huge fried calamari fan, but this was swimming in olive oil and fresh herbs...it was a lovely delight away from a typically americanized version. "We also ordered the tomato bisque and the soup of the day. These were insane! The best soups I've ever had out. The soup of the day was a roasted creamy mushroom soup and I almost licked my bowl clean. The flavors were outstanding and we all couldn't decide which soup was better. Make sure to definitely soak everything up with their delicious table bread that seemed to have just come out of the oven every time they replenished our basket! "Something worth passing is yes, the salads...they're just okay. But my friends raved about their pork and I will not forget the visual of my friend picking up the bone to lick it clean while our waiter just laughed at us! :) ""Best part of the story? Well, the food takes a lonnggg time to come out, (warning, but probably because it is so fresh!) after finishing our bottle, our neighboring diners also took advantage of the BYOB but seemed to have left half of theirs when they were done! So after a silly little dare, we became the table of three that snuck 3 large pours of wine and placed it back on their table! Hey! Who was going to drink it anyways?! The little portuguese owner came over and was sincerely shocked at how the wine bottle was empty...she asked, """"Did you three drink this?"""" We giggled and my friend's boyfriend said, """"YES."""" She smiled, and let us have our moment. ""We left a big tip. She obviously didn't mind. And it's places like this that make me miss home!""""Spectacular BYOB, don't miss it!""Superb French / Mediterranean inspired delicious food that is a adventurous, approachable and good value.  The place couldn't be cozier and service is always stellar.  We've been to Zinho probably 15 times and the experience is consistent, the staff is welcoming, the food is top notch. ""Call ahead because there can be a wait and the place is small and intimate and diners enjoy European style eating that is not rushed, so plan ahead.  Don't forget your favorite bottle (or bottles) of wine and be sure to share a glass with your server."""Went here for a private party: it was lovely.The owners and staff made this whole experience. It was a private birthday party and BYO. The staff made it fun and easy for use to relax and celebrate and the food was fantastic. We had a bit of a limited menu but EVERYTHING that I ate was great. "5 stars!""""Visiting from NY, we actually found this highly-rated restaurant on Yelp ... and we were certainly not disappointed! It's situated on a nice residential block near a large liquor store (byob).  The ambiance is fantastic and the staff are warm, friendly and attentive. We were seated in the private back room because no other tables were available. A real VIP treatment.  ""For starters, the goat cheese pastry and smoked salmon appetizers were to die for. Many of the others sounded great too.  Our daughter, who is at college here, was missing some of the food options of NY. Not any more. She had the lamb burger with feta cheese. I had the seafood stew and my wife had Chilean sea bass.  All fantastic! Thankfully we had just enough room for tres leches dessert. If anyone knows of a Portuguese restaurant this good in NYC ... or even in Newark Ironbound I'd love to hear about it.  We will definitely be back!""""Moved to Pittsburgh from Philly a year ago. Our standard for restaurants is ""if it were in Philly would be go back."" The answer for Cafe Zinho is YES.  One of the only excellent restaurants in the City (along with Salt and Dish). If you find the Big Burrito empire restaurants and their coy cats lackluster and are looking for something outstanding, go here. Cozy, BYO and excellent food, particularly if you go with the Portuguese items on the menu.  Our faves were the sardines to start and the fish stew for a main (OMG good).  Okay, in Philly I would give this four starts but for Pittsburgh, 5.""My boyfriend and I have gone two years in a row for Valentine's Day to this quaint and intimate restaurant. The decor is beautiful and the epitome of cozy, and the waitresses are welcoming and pleasant to talk to. On top if all of that, the food was absolutely delicious. If you have the chance, get their duck, it was perfectly spiced and cooked. Just bring your favorite bottle of wine with, and you have the makings of a romantic and pleasantly not wallet-breaking night out.""This place is categorized as ""Portugese"", but I thought the menu was more ""Mediterranian"" than anything else.  Bacalhau (dried salted fish - the national dish of Portugal) was nowhere on the menu; which is just fine by me!  The restauarnt has an eclectic decor and a nice setting.  The only tough part is parking in Shadyside... but on this night, I managed to get a spot right in front of the restaurant.""For dinner, I had lobster ravioli (a special) and my date had mushroom ravioli.  Both were outstanding.   Peering around at other tables, I saw several other delectable creations that I would like to return and try.  The Peri peri chicken looked quite good.""This another of the local BYOB restauarnts, which makes me happy.  We brought a nice bottle of Pinot Noir, which always helps to make the dining experience more pleasurable.""This is an excellent find... I will be back.  Soon.""""Most of the reviews we read called this place ""comfy"" or ""quaint,"" which translates into ""a very small restaurant."" It seems that the small size of the place ensures that every meal is attentively prepared because our food came out perfectly executed.""My husband had a crab and salmon tartar appetizer, while, simply from reading reviews, I walked in knowing what I wanted: goat cheese in puff pastry swimming in a shallow dish of creamy asian pear sauce. I literally wiped every bit of sauce off my plate with their bread.""Which, speaking of bread, the Portuguese cornbread is to die for. I highly recommend buying a $2 loaf to take home and (as recommended by one of the waitresses), make yourself a few thick slices of french toast.""For dinner, my husband had duck with a Grand Marnier sauce and I had Cornish game hen in a butter wine tarragon sauce. Both were served with simply dressed cauliflower, broccoli, peppers, and red potatoes. Again, we ate every bit of food off our plates and sopped up the extra sauce with our bread.""We did happen to order the two most expensive entrees on the menu, and both had appetizers, but I think $85 is absolutely reasonable for the high caliber food we received. Bring your own bottle of wine, order the specials, and take a loaf of bread home. We're sure happy that we did!""""FANTASTIC little restaurant. I had the duck... it was to die for. Food was delicious, atmosphere was warm, classy, inviting, and the staff members were all super kind and professional. Make sure you make a reservation, though... it's a tiny place. It's pricey... but worth every penny."Had a great dinner here. The Portuguese corn bread was delicious   The salmon with beet sauce was perfect. We enjoyed our dinner here- cozy and welcoming  atmosphere.  Don't forget dessert we had bread pudding and cookies and cream. We went on Valentines weekend so the price was higher than usual. Also like Byob although they charged 5 dollar corkage fee it is worth it to bring your own choice of wine. There is also fee for sharing plate but again worth it.   Will definitely go again."Best Mussels!!! They were large and quite tasty.  The starter bread is corn bread and it is absolutely addicting.  My boyfriend and I had dinner on a whim on a weekday and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  The setting is intimate and I enjoyed it.  I only wish we would've brought a bottle of wine since it's BYOB. The service was excellent as well. I have no complaints, even if it is CASH only I think it's worth it. ""NOTE: Cash only.  They do have an ATM inside for your convenience. BYOB""""My friends and I went there without a reservation on Thursday, and it seemed like there was only one small table in front the door left. We had no problem with it. All staff there are very friendly and helpful. The place is quite small so maybe you should make a reservation in advance. ""One of nice things about this place is BYOB ($5 per a wine bottle). If you don't bring anything. You can walk to Wine and Spirits, which is very close to the restaurant. So you can choose whatever you like to drink.""Most importantly, the food was great! We had chicken livers and octopus for appetizer. For main dishes, we had a whole fish with caper sauce, and lamb racks. The entree dishes cost from $20-$35, and $28 in average.""""What a gem of a place in Shadyside.  It s places like this that makes me miss living there.  Food was outstanding!  Because it was our first time, we wanted to do a little bit of this and that.  2 appetizers, Becky s salad and the special of the eve:  smoked salmon on crostini with creme fresh, a clam dish, forgot name, with the best tomatoe-white wine, I could have drunk from the bowl, broth; Becky s salad (the lemon dressing was out of this world delicious--again, could have drunk it, good).  I m usually not fan of walnut in my salad, but the crumbled goat cheese made me forget about my dislike of it, that I ate it happily.  Good pairing.  The special of the night, we opted for sharing the lamb shank with reduced red wine sauce and simple veggies.  Small veggie selection by american standards--half russet potato, slither of zucchini, and a stem of green onion, but the star afterall was the lamb, and it was meduim perfect, just as I ordered!  ""Would you care for some dessert?"""", Ramon, our waiter (he was fabulous!) asked.  And so round 3 begins.  Coffee, a chocolate mousse with whip cream, beauty and...  their version of creme brulee.  I thought it had a hint of peanut butter, but not sure.  Regardless it was  so, so divine.""This place was busy but we did not feel rushed, unlike most places.  The service was great, the atmoshphere quaint; it s definitely a neighbourhood cafe-- alot of repeat clientele, from what I gathered.  We shall return.""Finally, on an end note. Cafe Zinho is BYOB, so bring your favourite bottle or magnum of vino.  And they only take cash or personal check, but they do have an ATM.""""Had a wonderful experience with a large group of friends on a busy Labor Day weekend. We brought a few bottles of wine which we paired up with various apps and the dinner. Corkage was an extremely nominal fee which left room in the wallet for more delectable food. The service was smooth and very friendly. The atmosphere was inviting with a small European-style cafe restaurant vibe. Food was fresh and tasty according to all of my friends and was simply amazing from my perspective.  The sardines app and the Portuguese Mariscada seafood stew which I had/shared were cooked perfectly and flavorful. Chef/Owner Toni Pais's back story and his culinary skills are inspirational. He came out to eat afterwards and was very humble when he was given a round of applause. This is truly an underground spot worth finding when in the Burgh, a city that's now a hotbed for excellent food, and Cafe Zinho is one of the reasons why!"There are restaurants that are special because of the food and there are restaurants that are special because of the service.  CafÃ© Zinho is EVERYTHING."The proprietor of Zinho is one of the nicest gents in the business as far as I'm concerned.  I know this because I had occasion to collaborate with him on a few events 10 years ago.  So while I may be a bit biased, 10 years in between interactions sort of negates that in my opinion.  My point is, if you're one of those people that enjoys patronizing establishments run by nice people, Zinho fits the bill.  ""We arrived last night for my birthday dinner at 7:30 and I immediately fell in love with the place. Nestled along the """"homey"""" part of Ellsworth Avenue, Zinho exudes a relaxed luxury that might cater to customers of all types.  Our server Ramon was wonderful, and made thoughtful recommendations for each course.  I selected a roasted beet and goat cheese salad as a starter and crab cakes for my entrÃ©e.  Neither disappointed. The salad was a tower of carefully combined goodness and the crab cakes were stuffed, not with filler, but succulent crab.  While I'd get the crab cakes again, next time I'm in for the lamb, since one bite of Jonathan D's dish had me hooked so hard I practically baaa'ed (poor lamb).  At $180 for four people it isn't the cheapest option in the 'Burgh, but by no means is it the most expensive. AND, it's BYOB so bring a bottle and enjoy the wonderfulness that is CafÃ© Zinho."""The food here is really amazing. We ordered stuffed cornbread and vegetable soup as appetizers. For entree we had roasted duck and pork loin. They both taste really Portugal with a hint of sweetness. The downside of this restaurant is that they ONLY accept cash."Wow!  We were looking forward to this for our anniversary, and we weren't disappointed!""We splurged with three starters:  grilled sardines, octopus, and pheasant terrine.  Each was lovelier than the next.  The terrine was particularly delicious, served with some sort of artisanal mustard and pickled onions on the side, and some nicely grilled bread.  The octopus was perfectly cooked, not rubbery at all, but buttery, nicely seasoned and presented.  The sardines were grill-hot with an ever so slightly charred and crispy skin, and the accompanying vegetables were barely warm, which actually made for a nice contrast.""Main courses:  I had the shellfish stew from the menu.  All of the various seafood was perfectly cooked.  The broth could have had a bit more heat for my taste, but still: lovely.  The husband had one of the specials: cassoulet with venison osso buco. Heavenly, especially on a winter evening.  Gorgeous venison shanks and dome nicely roasted vegetables.""Another splurge: dessert.  We had the chocolate terrine and the key lime creme brÃ»lÃ©e, both of which were understated and luxurious.  Not fans of big, vulgar desserts, so these were right up our alley--rich, flavorful, just a nice sweet little end to a perfect meal.""Service was especially nice and attentive, but never intrusive.  Loved the shabby chic decor and the oddly shaped dining room.  Must be lovely in the summer with doors open in this quiet corner of Shadyside.  We'll definitely return to find out!""""Awesome BYOB Portuguese restaurant. Reservations are a must. Great service and atmosphere. Many times we have gone it has been for a selection of appetizers, salad and desert. Don't miss this restaurant if you are in Pittsburgh.""My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Always wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  Bring your own bottle.""This restaurant does NOT deserve the 4 Star Rating it has on Yelp...a 5 Star Rating is much more fitting.  Let's break it down:  a perfect cozy location off of Ellsworth, it's BYOB - which is always a bonus, an eclectic & intimate setting (get there early and request window seating), an attentive wait staff that is warm and welcoming...and I haven't EVEN gotten to the meal itself yet!  ""My husband and I took our 6 year old daughter there and we all had an amazing experience and delicious meal.  My husband's lamb burger melted in his mouth, my lamb chops were tender (medium rare) and juicy with just enough spices, my daughters spinach and cheese ravioli was so yummy she was practically licking her plate (insert appropriate level of parenting/manners ;~)""All in all, my 'foody family' gave this 'gem of a Portuguese/Mediterranean restaurant' an ENTHUSIASTIC THUMBS UP!  And, due to our phenomenal dining experience last night, will be making our next dining outing very soon to Cafe Zinho.""""Despite the bloody labor battles that were fought at the old Homestead Steel Mills, the Frick Art and Historical Center is a very beautiful and quiet place to spend the day.  It is complex of museums and  buildings set in several acres of lawns and gardens in Pittsburgh's East End.  It is a wonderful place to bring your out of town guests or just spend by yourself.""You begin your tour with the Helen Frick Art Museum, located on Reynolds Street.  It features  porcelains, bronzes, and rare examples of 17th and 18th-century furniture.  Current exhibits include Steel: Pittsburgh Drawings by Craig McPherson and A Panorama of Pittsburgh: Nineteenth-Century Printed Views. They will  remain on view through June 8, as part of Pittsburgh's 250th anniversary."Next we have the Car and Carriage Museum.  Henry Clay Frick was apparently quite an auto enthusiast.  His 1914 Rolls Royce Silver Ghost touring car is here as is the first car reportedly registered in Pittsburgh.  My husband Rick likes the 1931 Lincoln."Then we move on to my favorite, the Greenhouse, the Gardens, and the Lawns.  I believe that admission is free if you just want to stroll around the lawns, which I like to do on a Sunday in May.  In the late 19th Century, greenhouses were very popular with wealthy families.""Finally we come to the house itself, Clayton.  It was purchased for the then princely sum of $22,000 by the Frick's in 1882.  It is done in the Italianate style.  Over 93% of the furnishings in the house are original, and that's what makes it so wonderful.  You get a fair sense of how the Fricks lived--quite a contrast to the steelworkers!  ""No stop to the Frick is complete without visiting the cafe.  They believe that good food is an art too and the service here is wonderful.  I took a friend out for her birthday recently.  We had lunch at the cafe, the menu rotates seasonally.  I tried the Shrimp Tostones, which was sauted white shrimp, autumn sprouts, toasted almonds, guava cream, and annatto oil.  In the mood for more """"traditional"""" museum fare like hot dogs?  Then try the """"Ultimate Chili Dog"""".  Per the website, it is Grilled chicken apple sausage, wild boar chili, grated Gruyere cheese, caramelized onions, and mustard piccalilli on a sourdough roll!""Don't forget to have tea here too.  It is wonderful and the service is impeccable!  You and your guests can easily spend a whole afternoon here!"""
